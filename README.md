# <img src="https://www.altered.gg/apple-touch-icon.png" width="32" alt="Altered.gg Logo"/> Altered TCG Card Database

## 🎯 Goal
This project aims to provide a **community-driven repository** of all **Common and Rare** (non-unique) cards from the **Altered TCG**, available in all supported languages.

The purpose is to reduce unnecessary load on the official Altered API servers.  
Since repeated API calls may trigger throttling or overload, we recommend using this local JSON database first before sending new HTTP requests to the official API.

Cards images, assets, marketing materials, and other data can be found here: https://cdn.alteredcore.org

## 📂 Folder Structure

```bash
./

## 📜 Data Format
Each file inside `SETS/` and `CARDS/` contains the exact JSON structure returned by the official **Altered API**, with no modification to the schema (only separated by set and language).
The only manually added information is the collectorNumber, which is no longer present in the JSON data returned by the API.
