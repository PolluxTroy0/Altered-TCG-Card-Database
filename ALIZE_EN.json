They bump into each other, burst, merge and divide before breaking through the pulpy surface with a hiss and belch of colorful miasma. I feel the pressure of the Tumult all around me, releasing ideas with each swell that breaks through, ideas seeking to express themselves in the world by any means possible. There's clearly something pulsating at the bottom of the lake. Maybe it's a Tumult singularity buried hundreds of feet below me. All I can do is protect my boat from its devastating effects by using my Construct to individually remove the parasitic ideas beginning to sprout on its hull. It will be a hard crossing. The boat's kelonic motor is sputtering under the effects of the ideas jostling and pounding against it.\n\nI hope Oddball is doing all right. I probe into the distance, feeling his psyche answer me with a few short, miserable beeps. With my own senses, I can feel how badly his frame has been damaged by the intrusive ideas. Through our bond, I create the Eidolon of a Salvager at his side. My Alter Ego slows down, clearly relieved to have a pit stop – and he'll really need it to restore his armor, too. I leave him as I hear the first sounds of welding echoing in the twilit forest where he had been maneuvering, slaloming between the tree trunks. As for me, I'm not out of the woods yet either. Navigating this goopy lake is an interminable process, with the constant risk that, at any moment, a bubble could capsize the boat and throw me into the syrupy waters."

OK, this is the moment of truth. I switch on the kelonic battery, and my dorsal antenna starts to hum. Everything seems to be running smoothly. My Alter Ego barks, and I rummage in my pack for a bone-shaped dog treat. I throw it to him. He definitely deserves a little reward. While he devours it with happy munching sounds, I adjust the helmet on my head to make sure it fits tightly. By arranging my Construct, I summon a flashlight and point its light at the cave entrance. Right, it's time to see if there's any damned Kelon in these tunnels. And there had better be, because I'm fed up with returning empty-handed.\n\nAs I enter the cave, I can't help seeing it like a mouth about to swallow me up. I don't really want to end up like one of Marmo's dog treats, crunched up between a giant pair of jaws. The pink wafts of the Tumult part like curtains before me, pushed back by the waves of my antenna. Meanwhile, Marmo bounds along boldly, unaffected by the rolling mist. He even gorges on it, while I feel the Mana flowing into him like a battery being charged. I rearrange my Construct, forming a Kelon Elemental in front of me. The axolotl appears and starts to sniff the air. If there's Kelon in the area, the axolotl should react. Any second now… I see it suddenly rush forward. Ah! Bingo. I set off after it, grabbing my kelonic pickax. As I switch it on, the Kelon cylinder that powers it starts to pulse with a blue glow, bathing the chamber in a pale purple light."

The Ouroboros starts up, and its ring begins to spin as I ask my quartermaster what troops we have in addition to the Tagmata foot soldiers. I curse under my breath, but don't let it show as I listen to his explanations. Because of the troubles caused by the Belisenki, our contingents are already spread thin. I know we can count on a Bravos company, recently returned from an expedition, as a strike force. But it won't be able to cover the entire search area on its own, especially as the avalanche appears to have descended far down into the valley. While I can also deploy a few additional rescuers, we'll need a lot more if we hope to find any survivors.\n\nFinding another company will take too much time... What resources do we have available? Hmm, what if...? I suddenly turn to my chief mechanic and ask how many Brassbugs are on the Ouroboros. From his response, it seems that my idea just might work, even it sounds completely crazy. I want to parachute in a swarm of Brassbugs from the main bay... It might not be the most elegant strategy, but time is running out. I give my orders to my second-in-command. If he thinks those orders are insane, he doesn't show it. We fly through the clouds and head for the snowy pass. We'll be in position in less than a minute, but I know every second counts if there's any hope of rescuing survivors. Word comes to me that all the Brassbugs have been mobilized in the main hangar. Nothing left to do but cross our fingers that the plan works... and watch a horde of Brassbugs get dropped like a shower of shooting stars."

In the story, a penniless little girl wanders the streets on a freezing-cold New Year's Eve trying to sell boxes of matches, but no one is interested in buying them. Afraid to return home empty-handed where her abusive father is waiting, she takes shelter in an alley and tries to warm up by lighting her matches. With each one she strikes, she experiences a hallucination of something she's deprived of, but still longs for: the warmth of a hearth, delicious food, and her loving grandmother, who recently passed away. In the morning, passersby find her lifeless body, but she has a smile on her face."

The sky is overcast, and a harsh, cold wind has started to blow. It was strange to see her Eidolon here in this frozen landscape, rather than inside the Athanor. In just a few decades, all of Asgartha and nearly all Axiom technologies had been converted to use the energy source she had harnessed. In many ways, I also owed her for my partial use of my legs... She raises her arm to protect her face from the heavy snowflakes falling from the sky. With a flick of her wrist, Vaike powers on her hot air cannon, melting the ice to clear a path for our vehicles. With her help, it hadn't been difficult to convert the simple kelonic heater we'd been sent into a much more useful heat gun.\n\nWhen the weather gets milder, and the environment more passable than it is now, maybe I'll materialize an aircraft to finish the journey, even though that's not the most appealing thought. I concentrate to sense which direction Rossum went off in. But before I manage to connect to him, I suddenly hear voices shouting out to me. I listen carefully and hear it again through the wind's constant howl. It's a call for help. I squint and wipe my glasses, which are constantly fogging up. The voice is coming from the lake that stretches out in front of us, frozen and pummeled by the blizzard. There are several figures on the ice. I signal to Vaike, who turns her cannon up a notch. I also see Bash rushing off. And for good reason – there's no time to lose."

            "text": "Vaike Swiftwater... She leads the party through the snowy pass, occasionally using her heat cannon to melt the thick snow in front of her. The sky is overcast, and a harsh, cold wind has started to blow. It was strange to see her Eidolon here in this frozen landscape, rather than inside the Athanor. In just a few decades, all of Asgartha and nearly all Axiom technologies had been converted to use the energy source she had harnessed. In many ways, I also owed her for my partial use of my legs... She raises her arm to protect her face from the heavy snowflakes falling from the sky. With a flick of her wrist, Vaike powers on her hot air cannon, melting the ice to clear a path for our vehicles. With her help, it hadn't been difficult to convert the simple kelonic heater we'd been sent into a much more useful heat gun.\n\nWhen the weather gets milder, and the environment more passable than it is now, maybe I'll materialize an aircraft to finish the journey, even though that's not the most appealing thought. I concentrate to sense which direction Rossum went off in. But before I manage to connect to him, I suddenly hear voices shouting out to me. I listen carefully and hear it again through the wind's constant howl. It's a call for help. I squint and wipe my glasses, which are constantly fogging up. The voice is coming from the lake that stretches out in front of us, frozen and pummeled by the blizzard. There are several figures on the ice. I signal to Vaike, who turns her cannon up a notch. I also see Bash rushing off. And for good reason – there's no time to lose."

I grumble as I skid across the surface of the lake, and as I glance behind me, I see that Treyst has stopped on the shore. There's no way his big metallic beast can set foot on the ice. Nope. That would definitely be a bad idea. Using my hands, I slide rather than walk to the gaping hole that has appeared in the ice. I feel my heart tighten as I scan the oily ripples and unfathomable darkness that lurks beneath. A young woman wearing ice skates explains what happened. Child. Fell. Disappeared... I clench my teeth. I don't need her to spell it out.\n\nMarmo is circling around the hole and waiting for me to help him. I do what he wants and tap on my Construct to envelop him with a shell of heat. I watch him jump in. I close my eyes to look through his senses, and I notice a stream of bubbles rising to the surface. My Alter Ego looks all around, but sees nothing but darkness. We're going to need help... My fingers arrange and rearrange the buttons on the Construct and suddenly a walrus appears next to my dog, complete with a sonar rig and everything it needs to locate the little girl. Using my device, I send it instructions, then watch it dive into the depths. The animal uses its echolocation to probe the icy waters. Hurry, time is running out and every second counts..."

I hurry onto the breaking ice, which continues to make unsettling cracking noises. I grumble as I skid across the surface of the lake, and as I glance behind me, I see that Treyst has stopped on the shore. There's no way his big metallic beast can set foot on the ice. Nope. That would definitely be a bad idea. Using my hands, I slide rather than walk to the gaping hole that has appeared in the ice. I feel my heart tighten as I scan the oily ripples and unfathomable darkness that lurks beneath. A young woman wearing ice skates explains what happened. Child. Fell. Disappeared... I clench my teeth. I don't need her to spell it out.\n\nMarmo is circling around the hole and waiting for me to help him. I do what he wants and tap on my Construct to envelop him with a shell of heat. I watch him jump in. I close my eyes to look through his senses, and I notice a stream of bubbles rising to the surface. My Alter Ego looks all around, but sees nothing but darkness. We're going to need help... My fingers arrange and rearrange the buttons on the Construct and suddenly a walrus appears next to my dog, complete with a sonar rig and everything it needs to locate the little girl. Using my device, I send it instructions, then watch it dive into the depths. The animal uses its echolocation to probe the icy waters. Hurry, time is running out and every second counts..."

Its feet pierced the rock and attached to it, which had made the ascent relatively easy so far. I sigh and massage my thighs to get the blood circulating in my legs. For a few moments, as I scan the landscape below, I remember Paju beside me during our first flight as we looked out of the bay window to view all of Arkaster from the sky. Rossum places a hand on my shoulder. He feels my grief and emotions, of course. Fen put one of her scarves around his neck and taught him how to put on mittens. I can't help chuckling at how he looks in his gear, especially his sheepskin earmuffs. My Chimaera suddenly turns to the cliff, intrigued, and looks at whatever is below us.\n\nI turn around too to look down as best I can, although it hurts like hell. I see a porter attached to a rope and scaling the natural wall. Using her crampons, she swings from ledge to ledge with alarming ease. She hauls herself up, using her ice ax and grapple with masterful dexterity. I've rarely had the chance to see the porters of Svarograd in the flesh, and never in action until now. And I must say that their reputation is well deserved. Even carrying a heavy package, she maneuvers without the slightest hesitation. This isn't surprising, of course. All her life, she must have carried heavy loads up to the heights of the flying island of Enosha. Well, I thought I had a head start, but I was obviously mistaken."

Its feet pierced the rock and attached to it, which had made the ascent relatively easy so far. I sigh and massage my thighs to get the blood circulating in my legs. For a few moments, as I scan the landscape below, I remember Paju beside me during our first flight as we looked out of the bay window to view all of Arkaster from the sky. Rossum places a hand on my shoulder. He feels my grief and emotions, of course. Fen put one of her scarves around his neck and taught him how to put on mittens. I can't help chuckling at how he looks in his gear, especially his sheepskin earmuffs. My Chimaera suddenly turns to the cliff, intrigued, and looks at whatever is below us.\n\nI turn around too to look down as best I can, although it hurts like hell. I see a porter attached to a rope and scaling the natural wall. Using her crampons, she swings from ledge to ledge with alarming ease. She hauls herself up, using her ice ax and grapple with masterful dexterity. I've rarely had the chance to see the porters of Svarograd in the flesh, and never in action until now. And I must say that their reputation is well deserved. Even carrying a heavy package, she maneuvers without the slightest hesitation. This isn't surprising, of course. All her life, she must have carried heavy loads up to the heights of the flying island of Enosha. Well, I thought I had a head start, but I was obviously mistaken."

It's not easy working in this cold, especially on my own. Around me, the Brassbugs come and go, climbing the body of my unlucky Automaton. I tried my absolute hardest, but I should have known it wouldn't have been in its element in this frozen landscape. After one unfortunate misstep, I watched it tumble down the gorge like a ragdoll before crumpling dozens of meters below. I couldn't bring myself to abandon it there, even though retrieving it would cost precious time. And using valuable supplies to repair it was also out of the question. So all I could do was collect all the scraps of metal and try to make something out of them.\n\nOK, almost there. A shower of sparks crackles as a Brassbug welds a new chest plate onto my robotic prototype. It was salvaged from an old armored Scrambler, as was the shoulder piece. But the hardest part will be making a new leg. It may not have the most graceful gait, but an ungainly limp will be good enough if it means getting back to camp. I sigh and pass a hand over its damaged frame. Well, old boy, I promise I'll get you back in shape as soon as I can, but you'll need to help me a bit in return.  The Automaton starts to move its toes and suddenly lifts its head. I can't help smiling, and I pat its exoskeleton in encouragement. I step aside as it awkwardly tries to get up. Good. And when I've finishing repairing you, I promise to give you a suitable name."

It's not easy working in this cold, especially on my own. Around me, the Brassbugs come and go, climbing the body of my unlucky Automaton. I tried my absolute hardest, but I should have known it wouldn't have been in its element in this frozen landscape. After one unfortunate misstep, I watched it tumble down the gorge like a ragdoll before crumpling dozens of meters below. I couldn't bring myself to abandon it there, even though retrieving it would cost precious time. And using valuable supplies to repair it was also out of the question. So all I could do was collect all the scraps of metal and try to make something out of them.\n\nOK, almost there. A shower of sparks crackles as a Brassbug welds a new chest plate onto my robotic prototype. It was salvaged from an old armored Scrambler, as was the shoulder piece. But the hardest part will be making a new leg. It may not have the most graceful gait, but an ungainly limp will be good enough if it means getting back to camp. I sigh and pass a hand over its damaged frame. Well, old boy, I promise I'll get you back in shape as soon as I can, but you'll need to help me a bit in return.  The Automaton starts to move its toes and suddenly lifts its head. I can't help smiling, and I pat its exoskeleton in encouragement. I step aside as it awkwardly tries to get up. Good. And when I've finishing repairing you, I promise to give you a suitable name."

The orange flames and clanging machines couldn't be further away. Here, everything is white, and silence reigns. I bundle up in my padded coat and kneel on the frame of the damaged Reprocessor. While passing under an icy ledge, the vibrations it creates had caused ice stalactites and heavy scree to come crashing down. Thankfully, from what I can tell, most of the damage is superficial. A few repairs, a lick of paint, and it will be ready to go again. But I don't know if that's the wisest decision. The foreman has given his instructions, but I'm not sure the vehicle will survive the climb up the pass. Plus, its thick tracks have trouble navigating on the snow, especially at this altitude, where the snow keeps piling up day after day.\n\nI look up to the still-cloudless sky. First and foremost, I need to get some maintenance done while the weather's cooperating. I take out my Construct from my satchel and start to reconfigure it. The repair I'm planning will require a bit more Kelon than an ordinary repair, but it will save a significant amount of time. The figure of Vishvakarma materializes next to me, and the god opens his eyes as he spreads his arms. He's clearly the best choice to work on the armored vehicle. With a thin smile on his lips, he sits cross-legged as his tools appear in his oversized, robotic arms. The Reprocessor is in good hands, four of them in fact, thanks to the deity's two pairs of arms. Vishvakarma summons an assembly plan and scans it almost absent-mindedly. He then gets to work in a shower of sparks.\n\nSource\nRegarded as the architect and chief engineer of the universe, Vishvakarma is the Hindu god of artisans and builders. He was the architect of the palace of the devas and crafted all of their chariots and weapons, including Sharanga and Pinaka, the two bows he gave to Vishnu and Shiva respectively. While his creations are mostly physical, it is said that his piercing gaze goes far beyond matter and scrutinizes the abstract mechanisms that underlie reality."

The orange flames and clanging machines couldn't be further away. Here, everything is white, and silence reigns. I bundle up in my padded coat and kneel on the frame of the damaged Reprocessor. While passing under an icy ledge, the vibrations it creates had caused ice stalactites and heavy scree to come crashing down. Thankfully, from what I can tell, most of the damage is superficial. A few repairs, a lick of paint, and it will be ready to go again. But I don't know if that's the wisest decision. The foreman has given his instructions, but I'm not sure the vehicle will survive the climb up the pass. Plus, its thick tracks have trouble navigating on the snow, especially at this altitude, where the snow keeps piling up day after day.\n\nI look up to the still-cloudless sky. First and foremost, I need to get some maintenance done while the weather's cooperating. I take out my Construct from my satchel and start to reconfigure it. The repair I'm planning will require a bit more Kelon than an ordinary repair, but it will save a significant amount of time. The figure of Vishvakarma materializes next to me, and the god opens his eyes as he spreads his arms. He's clearly the best choice to work on the armored vehicle. With a thin smile on his lips, he sits cross-legged as his tools appear in his oversized, robotic arms. The Reprocessor is in good hands, four of them in fact, thanks to the deity's two pairs of arms. Vishvakarma summons an assembly plan and scans it almost absent-mindedly. He then gets to work in a shower of sparks.\n\nSource\nRegarded as the architect and chief engineer of the universe, Vishvakarma is the Hindu god of artisans and builders. He was the architect of the palace of the devas and crafted all of their chariots and weapons, including Sharanga and Pinaka, the two bows he gave to Vishnu and Shiva respectively. While his creations are mostly physical, it is said that his piercing gaze goes far beyond matter and scrutinizes the abstract mechanisms that underlie reality."

My breathing is ragged, and I pour a tub of lukewarm water over my head to try and bear the heat a little longer. Not far from the molten metal, I see Gibil capturing a jet of lava. He brings it closer to him and lets it drift in the air as he examines it for any defects or impurities. As the water I soaked myself with steams around me, a worker ruffles my hair to congratulate me on my endurance. I return his smile and take the tubs of silica to the god at work. Struggling to keep my eyes open as scorching drafts blow against my face, I set down the buckets and move back, when from the corner of my eye, I see a Brassbug shutting down. I approach and watch it slump, drained of energy. I check its Kelon cylinder and notice it's still almost full.\n\nI place a hand on its head, realizing that it's dying. Some of its kindred will soon collect it and recycle it, maybe to create a new one, but I'm not too familiar with their life cycle. Behind me, I hear the rumble of Gibil's voice, demanding that we bring him something else to melt and forge. His glowing eyes turn towards me and the little shape struggling at my feet. Then, using his hand, he reaches out and draws the Brassbug to him. With the simple force of his will, the god disassembles the little robotic creature. He then takes an arc of lava and shapes and sculpts it to create a new chassis, a wing and new parts for the Brassbug. After giving it a new lease on life, Gibil places it in the crook of my arms as if asking me to take care of it from now on...\n\nSource\nGibil was the Mesopotamian god of all things related to fire, both its positive aspects (source of heat and light) and its negative aspects (destructive and voracious). He was the patron deity of blacksmiths and metallurgists, and he also played a role in ritual purification. But beware his wrath! It was said that lightning strikes were a sign of Gibil's anger when they struck the ground and the fields, or when they set homes alight. His symbol was a torch, which could be held at night to light the way or chase away evil spirits."

My breathing is ragged, and I pour a tub of lukewarm water over my head to try and bear the heat a little longer. Not far from the molten metal, I see Gibil capturing a jet of lava. He brings it closer to him and lets it drift in the air as he examines it for any defects or impurities. As the water I soaked myself with steams around me, a worker ruffles my hair to congratulate me on my endurance. I return his smile and take the tubs of silica to the god at work. Struggling to keep my eyes open as scorching drafts blow against my face, I set down the buckets and move back, when from the corner of my eye, I see a Brassbug shutting down. I approach and watch it slump, drained of energy. I check its Kelon cylinder and notice it's still almost full.\n\nI place a hand on its head, realizing that it's dying. Some of its kindred will soon collect it and recycle it, maybe to create a new one, but I'm not too familiar with their life cycle. Behind me, I hear the rumble of Gibil's voice, demanding that we bring him something else to melt and forge. His glowing eyes turn towards me and the little shape struggling at my feet. Then, using his hand, he reaches out and draws the Brassbug to him. With the simple force of his will, the god disassembles the little robotic creature. He then takes an arc of lava and shapes and sculpts it to create a new chassis, a wing and new parts for the Brassbug. After giving it a new lease on life, Gibil places it in the crook of my arms as if asking me to take care of it from now on...\n\nSource\nGibil was the Mesopotamian god of all things related to fire, both its positive aspects (source of heat and light) and its negative aspects (destructive and voracious). He was the patron deity of blacksmiths and metallurgists, and he also played a role in ritual purification. But beware his wrath! It was said that lightning strikes were a sign of Gibil's anger when they struck the ground and the fields, or when they set homes alight. His symbol was a torch, which could be held at night to light the way or chase away evil spirits."

Their parachutes open one by one and they fall towards the drop point, a few hundred meters from our location. I watch the billowing sails drifting on the wind and the sealed crates they're carrying. One of them bears the Cornucoopia logo, which means they're food provisions. The emblem on the other one belongs to our Faction, so it probably contains technical gear to replace the equipment we've worn to shreds on our travels. It's not a moment too soon. I hand the binoculars over to Rossum, who also takes a look at them. He had loved walking in the snow for the first few days, until he realized that the moisture was causing little mechanical glitches. Now he spends more time clinging to my vehicle to avoid getting his joints wet.\n\nWell, no point twiddling our thumbs. We should hurry, actually, before the cold seizes up all this brand-new gear. I press the power button on my spider, and it shakes to life. Its legs begin to tremble. With a push, the cockpit rises, and I engage the lever to get us on our way. With each step, the legs test the ground, and only when there's enough resistance do they finally take the full weight of the frame. It's slow and tedious, but tumbling into a crevasse is not something I can really afford to deal with. Further ahead, in the clearing that was chosen as the supply drop, I can already see the metal crates gleaming with a green shimmer. Now that I have eyes on them, I remotely turn off the beacons that help us to easily locate them. So, Rossum, what do you think Santa has sent us this time? His only answer is a shrug."

Their parachutes open one by one and they fall towards the drop point, a few hundred meters from our location. I watch the billowing sails drifting on the wind and the sealed crates they're carrying. One of them bears the Cornucoopia logo, which means they're food provisions. The emblem on the other one belongs to our Faction, so it probably contains technical gear to replace the equipment we've worn to shreds on our travels. It's not a moment too soon. I hand the binoculars over to Rossum, who also takes a look at them. He had loved walking in the snow for the first few days, until he realized that the moisture was causing little mechanical glitches. Now he spends more time clinging to my vehicle to avoid getting his joints wet.\n\nWell, no point twiddling our thumbs. We should hurry, actually, before the cold seizes up all this brand-new gear. I press the power button on my spider, and it shakes to life. Its legs begin to tremble. With a push, the cockpit rises, and I engage the lever to get us on our way. With each step, the legs test the ground, and only when there's enough resistance do they finally take the full weight of the frame. It's slow and tedious, but tumbling into a crevasse is not something I can really afford to deal with. Further ahead, in the clearing that was chosen as the supply drop, I can already see the metal crates gleaming with a green shimmer. Now that I have eyes on them, I remotely turn off the beacons that help us to easily locate them. So, Rossum, what do you think Santa has sent us this time? His only answer is a shrug."

Although the Reprocessor and its drivers are now out of danger, the same can't be said of the Ordis soldiers bringing up the rear of our convoy. The snow hammering down on the ridges has detached multiple blocks of ice, which are now tumbling to the bottom of the valley. I need to do something. Oddball. My Chimaera has already set off before I even signal to him. I watch him fly down at full throttle, slaloming between the masses of fallen rocks, furious billowing powder and shards of ice as sharp as flint. Like a deadly fog, the avalanche buries the Aegis recruits, swallowing them like a hungry wave collapsing on the shore. I clench my teeth.\n\nAs each body disappears under the roaring snow, my Alter Ego drops a beacon in a desperate attempt to help locate them more accurately once the wave stops. I can no longer see them from where I am. All I see is a cloud filling the valley. But through the sensors that my companion has dropped, I see a completely different scene. Snowy squalls are still moving in slow motion, settling on the rocky foothills. Dazed soldiers are flailing about as they try to extract themselves from the snow. We need help, and we need it immediately if we're to get them out of there. Responding to my thoughts, Oddball starts to emit a distress signal on all official channels. With a bit of luck, other teams won't be too far away and can respond to our request for help. But I still can't afford to sit around twiddling my thumbs. Using Alteration, I turn my prostheses into little snowblades. And without further ado, I set off."

Although the Reprocessor and its drivers are now out of danger, the same can't be said of the Ordis soldiers bringing up the rear of our convoy. The snow hammering down on the ridges has detached multiple blocks of ice, which are now tumbling to the bottom of the valley. I need to do something. Oddball. My Chimaera has already set off before I even signal to him. I watch him fly down at full throttle, slaloming between the masses of fallen rocks, furious billowing powder and shards of ice as sharp as flint. Like a deadly fog, the avalanche buries the Aegis recruits, swallowing them like a hungry wave collapsing on the shore. I clench my teeth.\n\nAs each body disappears under the roaring snow, my Alter Ego drops a beacon in a desperate attempt to help locate them more accurately once the wave stops. I can no longer see them from where I am. All I see is a cloud filling the valley. But through the sensors that my companion has dropped, I see a completely different scene. Snowy squalls are still moving in slow motion, settling on the rocky foothills. Dazed soldiers are flailing about as they try to extract themselves from the snow. We need help, and we need it immediately if we're to get them out of there. Responding to my thoughts, Oddball starts to emit a distress signal on all official channels. With a bit of luck, other teams won't be too far away and can respond to our request for help. But I still can't afford to sit around twiddling my thumbs. Using Alteration, I turn my prostheses into little snowblades. And without further ado, I set off."

My mechanical spider continues to move forward, but I can feel that its movements aren't as smooth, as if the legs were gradually getting jammed and slowing down. It's obvious what's happening. It's ice penetrating everywhere, into its body, into its joints... I should have winterized it more. Thankfully, we've now arrived at the camp, and I can get down to some maintenance. But that sense of relief doesn't last. Rossum beeps an alert at me, and I guess what's wrong with a quick glance. I see my companions shivering, frozen stiff. We should have been quicker. I curse to myself, but feeling guilty won't help. I activate my exoskeleton, which sputters. It's also having trouble starting. As soon as I feel the connections being made, I stamp my foot and move my joints to get rid of the ice.\n\nI get down from my vehicle and head to the crates I had gone to retrieve. I open one of them and rummage around inside. Nothing interesting. I grumble and move on to the next one. My heart skips a beat when I find a kelonic heater. This is just what we need. I haul it onto my shoulders and head over to the group of engineers. Huddled together around a fire, they're shivering from head to toe. Their lips are blue, and their clothes are frozen stiff. I place the heater on the ground and turn the knob to maximum. The spiral element begins to glow red, emitting a gentle heat that melts the snow around. Small droplets start to drip from their suits as the ice begins to melt. More workers gather round to warm up, and I notice one of them giving me a subtle nod. They'll thank me later when their teeth stop chattering..."

My mechanical spider continues to move forward, but I can feel that its movements aren't as smooth, as if the legs were gradually getting jammed and slowing down. It's obvious what's happening. It's ice penetrating everywhere, into its body, into its joints... I should have winterized it more. Thankfully, we've now arrived at the camp, and I can get down to some maintenance. But that sense of relief doesn't last. Rossum beeps an alert at me, and I guess what's wrong with a quick glance. I see my companions shivering, frozen stiff. We should have been quicker. I curse to myself, but feeling guilty won't help. I activate my exoskeleton, which sputters. It's also having trouble starting. As soon as I feel the connections being made, I stamp my foot and move my joints to get rid of the ice.\n\nI get down from my vehicle and head to the crates I had gone to retrieve. I open one of them and rummage around inside. Nothing interesting. I grumble and move on to the next one. My heart skips a beat when I find a kelonic heater. This is just what we need. I haul it onto my shoulders and head over to the group of engineers. Huddled together around a fire, they're shivering from head to toe. Their lips are blue, and their clothes are frozen stiff. I place the heater on the ground and turn the knob to maximum. The spiral element begins to glow red, emitting a gentle heat that melts the snow around. Small droplets start to drip from their suits as the ice begins to melt. More workers gather round to warm up, and I notice one of them giving me a subtle nod. They'll thank me later when their teeth stop chattering..."

While every part of me is trying to prevent a collision, Skadi has the audacity to perform acrobatics with the nonchalance of a true expert. She moves effortlessly. She just glides, easily and naturally. It's annoying... and a little demoralizing. I'm an expert in the art of movement, but this is too much for me. I pant for breath, hands gripping the poles tightly. She turns towards me without paying attention to the obstacles below, and treats me to a display of the moves she wants me to do. I'm about to respond when I realize a tree is far too close to me. I have to plant a pole instantly to quickly change course and avoid catastrophe.\n\nShe laughs and gives me a thumbs up. And then she's off again, in a single bound. Fascinated, I watch her graceful aerial ballet. Idiot! I didn't see the bump that she just jumped! I go flying, limbs everywhere, legs above my head... I fall inelegantly into a snowdrift, which saves me from a more painful crash, but my ego has been severely damaged. The Eidolon stops gently next to me, while I struggle to get up, fighting with my skis. She shakes her head, flapping her long braid of blonde hair. With a smirk on her face, she patiently waits until I'm standing up before teasing me about the trick I just pulled off. Brushing the snow off my clothes, I try to find a witty comeback. No. Best to keep a low profile. I feel like even the snowmen around the camp are laughing at me.\n\nSource\nSkadi is a deity from Norse mythology: the goddess of winter, mountains and hunting. She is the daughter of the giant Thjazi and wife of the god Njörd. The name Scandinavia, which could mean \"Skadi's island\", may be named after her. After the death of her father, killed by the gods of Asgard, she takes up arms against them to seek vengeance. But the Aesir, aware of her just cause, pardon her rebellion and offer her suitable compensation, including placing Thjazi's eyes in the sky in the form of stars shining in the heavens."

Not far from me, Catriona is summoning the idea of heat itself to warm up an Ordis recruit. I feel a warm air current caress my face and start to dream of a hot place to relax my muscles, like I saw those damned Lyra doing just yesterday. Ha! I suddenly feel exhausted from the extra effort we've had to put in, barely a few hours after returning from the expedition. We didn't even have time to rest or finish our bowl of soup... But I don't regret answering the call, considering all the people we're saving. That obviously justifies the extra soreness we'll feel after this ordeal.\n\nAs I watch the Bravos rescuer, I wonder where her younger sister Aoife is. Maybe she was deployed on the western flank to help or guide the little Brassbug army that was dropped from the Ouroboros? Or did she stay onboard? Whereas Aoife is an experienced adventurer who can sometimes take a few too many risks, Cat radiates kindness and generosity. And with Aoife's tendency to rush in, having someone to take care of minor wounds once the job is done is a great help. They are certainly polar opposites. But they also clearly complement each other. That was evident at the start of their training, and it's still the case. I smile in spite of everything. With Chagha, solid and taciturn as a rock, and Cat, dedicated and always calm, it seems my little protégé is in good hands."

So when I saw Skadi carelessly drop her equipment bag next to the camp and go for a walk, well, it just felt like too good of an opportunity. Quick glance to the left, then to the right. No one around. And so I start rummaging through her gear. Inside, I find lots of things she must use for hunting and living in the mountains. Rope, carabiner, whetstone... But something else immediately grabs my attention: a pair of boots. They are bright red, have a strange design, and are simply begging to be tried on. And because I'm so polite, I can't say no. What harm could it do? And I need to know if they're my size. Without further hesitation, I slip a boot on. It seems to adapt to my foot, expanding in length and width to envelop my foot like a stocking. Cool, they're so comfortable!\n\nA strange knob on the ankle turns on and flashes red. That's right, Kojo, you should always press flashing red knobs. Maybe it adjusts the temperature? A heated boot: That would be so cool! Well, hot, I guess. I turn the knob to see what it does. A set of spurs shoots out from under the sole. Er, is that what it's supposed to do? Well, it's not heating, but still cool: These mountaineering crampons could be really useful. And because I can't help myself, I go looking for other hidden features. I turn the knob another notch. Whoosh! A blade-shaped flame shoots out from a ridge in the middle of the sole. I move back slightly in surprise. Wow, is that an ice skate? Someone suddenly taps me on the shoulder, and I know I've been busted. That floozie Skadi has her arms folded across her chest and is looking at me rather disapprovingly."

The frozen walls on either side of the narrow path leading to the rocky spur chill each gust into an ever more painful slap to the face. Each blast of wind brings flurries of snowflakes that hit us in waves. I regularly force myself to stop staring fixedly at the tracks in front of me and raise my head to look up towards the snowy peak that will be our ultimate destination. Though the summit looms larger with each stride, the distance to reach it still seems too long and insurmountable. The silvery glints we can see on the mountaintop warn us that we'll need to use our ice axes to scale its face. I repeatedly say a little prayer that our equipment will withstand this expedition. From this distance, it's hard to gauge the layer of ice that we'll be dealing with during the ascent.\n\nFor a brief moment, I remember the heights of the Vanderun Shards and the morning sun bathing my face with its light. That's when she would always appear to me – my heart, my love – to hold me tightly in her arms... Deep in thought, it takes me a second to notice that the sound of the wind has changed. What was previously a bleak, nagging moan has become a rumble, like the breathing of a buried giant. It almost sounds like the growling of a dragon. I focus on it and surmise that it's coming from the peak. The vibration intensifies and rattles the whole length of my spine. Fear grips me. I look ahead and realize that what I was dreading is actually happening. At the end of the ledge, my two guides have stopped, frozen in horror as the avalanche barrels directly towards them."

I follow the tracks. As I continue the hunt, lost in thought, the Wind carries a whistle to me... or a warbling to be more precise. It's rhythmic, very repetitive, like a tune you might hum nonchalantly while doing something else. A feeling of satisfaction emanates from this stunted melody, a declaration of joy. I move closer to the source of the sound. Crowbar covers me from the rear, of course. Hidden behind a barrier of snow-covered fir trees, I finally see a sort of clearing strewn with all sorts of odds and ends. A jumble of items lies on the ground: a bucket with binoculars inside, a flashlight, a pile of books with a mug on top... Taking stock of everything feels like an Ordis nursery rhyme: It makes my head spin.\n\nBut it's not a garbage dump. All the items are in perfect condition. And besides, I recognize some of them! Those headphones, that's Tamati's! It was stolen from the camp a couple of days ago. One, two, three, four things... With horror, I realize this is a thief's den. And then I see a strange figure enter the clearing. It's an elegant cross between a magpie and a penguin. Clearly pleased with himself, he waddles around, carrying on his back a pack filled with items as disparate as those strewn across the ground. He's even wearing a hat I remember from another expedition. And I'm confident that its owner didn't have webbed feet and an orange beak. He's probably just dropping off his plunder from his latest loot run. I look at what he's carrying: cartographers' papers, chocolate eggs... No! He's also got the rolling pin that Hestia uses. How will she make those delicious cookies now?"

The problem is that it makes me want to open them. I take a quick look around me, just to be on the safe side. The little gnomes are all busy folding, wrapping and packing. Haha, there's even one having trouble with the mechanical conveyor that the Axiom installed to \"optimize\" the shipping process. Hmm... What if I were to press a few buttons and speed up the belt, just to give their productivity numbers a little boost? I mean, that would also happen to be the perfect diversion so I could grab a couple of packages. There are so many that no one would notice if three or four were to go missing, surely! OK, the production line is starting to get a bit more hectic. Now I just need to choose which gifts look the most promising!\n\nSource\nA Nisse, also known as a Tomte, is a pint-sized humanoid creature from Scandinavian folklore.

He's running quite a temperature... No wonder he's been feeling so weak since yesterday. I fidget slightly on my stool, waiting for the gardener to finish with his current patients. The otter grabs a pot and fills it with little balls of clay, a bit of bark and some damp soil. Then he grabs the first sentient plant and gently places it in the rehab container. The otter tenderly repots the patient as though making a bed and places it close to a light source to ensure it gets enough rays to jump-start the process of photosynthesis. He does the same with the little Coneman, then attends to the little Sneezer Shroom who can't stop spluttering out clouds of half-filtered spores.\n\nNow it's Spike's turn to be cared for. The repotter otter places him in a pot and pats down the earth around his little feet, then wraps the bundle up warmly. He then removes the wilted flowers covering Spike's head so that the new buds can bloom more easily. Once Spike is feeling better, new bright-red corollae will open over his cute little face, and he'll definitely be anxious to get moving again. He's never had much patience for being stuck somewhere with nothing to do. But until then, he needs to get some rest. As for me, I must admit, a little downtime will do me good. I desperately miss plunging my hands into fresh soil, and there's still plenty to do in the greenhouse. I gently run my hand over my Chimaera's head, which is already drooping from exhaustion. I hate to see him bedridden like this, and I hope his recovery won't take too long…"

The web-footed creature zigzags through the trees, hopping and occasionally sliding on its belly to pick up speed down the snowy slopes. In its bag, it's carrying all kinds of little trinkets stolen from the camp, including the ring Hasret gave back to me. That ring carries far too many bittersweet memories: from the day she accepted it from me, trying to hide her emotions behind a wall of sarcasm and indifference, to the night she returned it, knowing that our days together before my departure were coming to an end… There's no way I'm letting some damn bird steal it from me. Using Heka, I stamp a Glyph onto the trunk of an old birch and a pack of bloodhounds leaps out, yapping and barking excitedly.\n\nLet the hunt begin! The dogs immediately begin sniffing out the tracks, then quickly set off in pursuit. That thieving bird might have been able to shake me off its trail, but it won't escape my dogs. Fen was right to ask for my help. She had assigned me to find its nest, filled with its illicit spoils. And now my hounds are catching up to the plunderer. In a panic, it drops a few items, which plop softly into the snow. But no matter how fast it runs, it will end up cornered. I suddenly hear squealing and oinking. I stop running and look over to see the Three Little Pigs scampering towards me. They look like they're being chased by some indescribable danger. I curse to myself, knowing full well that I can't just leave without helping them. I whistle to my dogs to send them towards the camp. Then I yell at the Eidolons – whoever may have summoned them – to follow my pups right away."

Look, Taru, it looks like it's standing at attention. My Alter Ego bends down to observe the banded larva, not the least bit impressed. I even sense silent rebukes budding at the edges of my mind and coming through in his grumpy behavior – because it's cold, because there's still a long road ahead, and because he's the only one keeping an eye on our surroundings while I spend my time contemplating crystalline leaves and the unreal beauty of the taiga. OK, message received loud and clear, buddy. I remind him that what I'm doing is not just a waste of time because part of our mission is to log anything interesting we see so that we can report it to the Expeditionary Corps. He raises his tentacles in response, as if saying, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever.\"\n\nI sigh in resignation… and with some irritation, to be honest. When he gets in one of his moods, I know it's no use trying to cheer him up. Looking more closely at the caterpillar, I see it weaving a little ball of Mana, as though the larva itself were secreting it. And as it does so, its physical body becomes translucent, almost transparent. Could it be starting its transformation into a chrysalis? I think again of Saskia and of everything she explained to me that day, including the life cycle of these Mana moths, from the larval state to their final form. As I learned about the unique characteristics of these little insects, I had wondered if the solution might be found not in magic alone but perhaps in biology. After listening to my story over a cup of tea – or several, actually – she had told me that she'd help me find a cure for my sister. And it felt good to finally share that with someone."

When I told him about the connection between the moths and these creatures that have harassed us so relentlessly, I assumed he'd use that knowledge to repel them, not to mow them down like this. But no matter how loudly I yell, he can't – or won't – hear me. It's as though something had suddenly taken possession of him, turning him into its puppet. And our enemies aren't the only victims of his fury. I see Ordis soldiers staggering and crawling to shelter, or raising their shields to protect themselves from the terrifying wind. I see scattered Bravos fighters anchoring themselves to rocks as best they can. But the ropes soon snap, and they're carried away into the swirling chaos of the snowstorm being fed by the warlock's power.\n\nA snowy ledge collapses and is swept away in the howling gusts. I see tents lifted from the ground and torn to shreds. Fires are blown out like birthday candles. And the snow starts to cover everything. An Axiom Reprocessor is buried under a huge mound of powder, and a tree summoned by Alteration is uprooted and swallowed up in the spiraling wind. This is a catastrophe. I must do something. At this point, the cure is worse than the disease. It's as though someone were using Afanas as a conduit to pump out a bottomless well of ideas about a storm. But how to stop such a torrential flow? By cutting it off at the source? No. Before that, I need to stop the immediate threat. And I know of only one person in the whole history of Asgartha who's ever managed to stand firm against this kind of devastation…"

Though Taru never stopped telling me it was a waste of time, I continued to light up my Irises every time I found myself near a Mana moth, dissecting them with my eyes at every opportunity. Horomancy is a versatile discipline, especially when combined with the principles of Eidomancy, which Kuwat taught me. I knew I could do it. I just knew I could. Of course, I had started by using an Effigy, but after a few failed attempts, I'd realized that using a physical statue was not suited to the nature of Mana moths. It's much better to materialize them by calling on something that evokes their fleeting nature… and what better than the ephemeral art of dance? Ready for a spot of ballet, Taru?\n\nWithout waiting for his answer, I perform a quick ballonné, followed by a series of déboulés. Meanwhile, Taru uses all his limbs to perform some enchanting moves of his own. I see him spinning like a sun as I alternate between pas de bourrées and arabesques. Our combined Kinemancy skills quickly manifest a swarm of moths in the world. By studying them day after day, I've learned by heart their behavior patterns, their translucent anatomy, the linguistic characteristics of their flight… all for the chance to call on them one day. And as I throw myself into a grand jeté, I silently thank Bogna for having been such a strict dance teacher. With each pirouette, more and more moths appear, gathering into compact swarms. Crafting creatures with such a tenuous grip on life from ideas and Mana isn't difficult at all. But will the Belisenki be fooled by this little trick?"

They offer nothing more than an illusion of life, a simulacrum. Because the world tree before me is most certainly dead. Wedged between the twin spurs of the Cais Adarra, the venerable giant seems as listless as an old man. All life has left it, and it's a mere shadow of its former self, a husk that will gradually wither away. In fact, its trunk is no longer made of wood, but of crystal. If all the moths flew away this very second, all that would remain would be a bent, scrawny, sickly old tree. An elderly ghost, bound for oblivion. Ultimately, everything here is pure illusion…\n\nI force Lindiwe to raise her eyes, and she looks into the darkness lurking between the two peaks. The night that has fallen over the gorge sparkles with snowflakes, which drift through the air like rising and falling stars. Following my instructions, my host takes a sip of Arcolano Milk and inspects the world tree's remains through her Irises. Its transparent bark seems scarred, as though covered with bite marks and puncture wounds. I realize that it has been sucked dry on many occasions. Could the moths have done this? But more importantly, the tree seems to contain something. There's a worm in the apple… a parasite. Lindiwe narrows her eyes to give me a clearer view of what's incubating beneath its surface. There's something most definitely out of place… like a snake gliding along its branches and roots. There's something clearly feeling very cramped in there…"

The primal force of the cold, which I was able to observe elsewhere on a smaller scale, is much stronger here. Great swaths of a past life are imprisoned in the ice, walled up for all eternity, frozen in motion. I feel as though I'm visiting a museum, with the models in each exhibit displayed behind a thick sheet of glass. Here we see a stag. Over there, a flock of birds flying in formation. There's even some kind of tentacled mammoth, encased in a frigid shell in mid-charge, or perhaps it was trying to flee whatever trapped it here. And scenes like these extend as far as the eye can see among the towering walls of this icy labyrinth. It's as if we were exploring a natural history exhibition and casually inspecting its stuffed specimens.\n\nFar off at the end of the procession, I see the Cais Adarra, lit up by a sky that is finally at peace. As the clouds part, the sun's rays reach down into the pass, lighting up the walls and providing us with some welcome visibility along with a spectacular light show among the dizzying frozen facades. A reflection draws my eye upwards to what looks like a Glyph, right in the middle of an ice wall. It's only semi-transparent and subtle enough to be easily missed by the uninitiated. I send Senka to find out more about the fascinating symbol as I put my Gephyromancy to work. By absorbing the ideas contained in the Sigil, I'll be able to… But I don't have time to learn more about it. The ground suddenly begins to tremble. Up ahead, I hear screams of terror from part of the group. It takes me a few seconds to notice that the walls are beginning to split. And I realize too late that this earthquake is the result of my arrogant curiosity."

Her drenched pink and green winter jacket is hung out above the fire, where it shows little sign of thawing. I place another blanket around her and rub her shoulders. Although her black hair is already dry, her skin is still pale after her prolonged dip under the ice. To say she was lucky we were passing by would be an understatement. Judging by the tracks on the frozen lake, it was probably the many sleds passing by that had weakened the ice layer. It was only a matter of time before it gave way. I notice that she hasn't touched her hot chocolate, and that little tears are forming in the corners of her eyes. She must still be traumatized after what she just went through. And for good reason. The little one was very close to tragedy.\n\nMarmo barks next to me and whines in my mind. Yes, yes, I understand. We'll try to take her mind off things a bit. I take a deep breath and empty my mind. Then, using my Construct, I summon the idea of the Little Match Girl. I estimate she must be about the same age, or maybe even a little younger. She suddenly appears, with bright red hair, sitting cross-legged on the snow and giving me a knowing look. The young Lyra stares at her as she carefully opens her little case and takes out a box of matches. She strikes a match against the phosphorous, sending out sparks which turn into a hissing flame. She strikes another... Each time they ignite, a little robotic insect emerges from the fire: a metal butterfly or firefly. I smile. During these little moments of distraction, the young survivor seems to forget all about the cold.\n\nSource\nThe Little Match Girl is a Danish fairy tale written by Hans Christian Andersen. In the story, a penniless little girl wanders the streets on a freezing-cold New Year's Eve trying to sell boxes of matches, but no one is interested in buying them. Afraid to return home empty-handed where her abusive father is waiting, she takes shelter in an alley and tries to warm up by lighting her matches. With each one she strikes, she experiences a hallucination of something she's deprived of, but still longs for: the warmth of a hearth, delicious food, and her loving grandmother, who recently passed away. In the morning, passersby find her lifeless body, but she has a smile on her face."

I know I'm climbing along the floating island, but the concept of up and down doesn't really apply here. From where I am, it's like I'm running on flat ground. I look up. Above me, another island floats upside-down in the air. From my inverted position, I see herds of yaks, or animals that look like yaks, grazing peacefully before they scatter at my approach. With a bit of luck… Using Alteration, I create a rocky promontory at my feet. It shoots out from the ground toward the other island. I let myself be carried along with it, adjusting my stance. But as I approach the inverted island, I feel gravity switch directions and suddenly pull me upwards, which is actually now downwards.\n\nI jump and turn in the air, landing on the other side and rolling in the high grass. OK, if I continue along this atoll, it should get me to my destination. But before I continue with my run, I check in on Booda's spirit. He's on a similar island. I feel the wind blowing past his ears as he crosses the rugged plains of the Tilted Steppes. Yaks shamble away as he approaches, and he yowls at them to make them get out of his way. He isn't far off. Not far at all. And he's vibrating with the Mana he's stolen from the Tumult. I smile. In a few hours at most, we'll meet each other. I'll use all the Mana he's collected to stabilize the area and paint it in Bravos colors. Unless another Exalt manages to do it before us. In their dreams! I set off again at a sprint."

The water swishes against my skin as Kaizaimon meanders back and forth, patiently waiting for the right time to come out of hiding. In the spectral darkness, the roaring waves crash against the cliff as a lightning bolt streaks across the raging sky. Around me, the other Bravos soldiers lie on their stomachs, hidden and on the look-out. I see them cursing the cold and water as it penetrates deep into their clothes, but none of them complain. I smile. A few drops of water won't make them waver or shiver. Suddenly, Kai pours out of my skin in a red cloud like a bloody mist. My oni gradually solidifies and regains his original appearance. He starts to float above the bluff where we have taken refuge, waiting to tighten the noose of our ambush.\n\nHe looks at the sky, and I do the same, just as a griffon breaks through the clouds. The griffon flies toward the beach with Sigismar on his back. That means it's not far behind. I crack my neck and knuckles. Around me, the other warriors slowly spread out. Some roll their shoulders, while others unsheathe their swords. I turn toward them and give them a smile. They return it. But not with smiles of kindness – more like predatory grins. Good thing that's exactly what I need. Today, I need them to be demons. I scream at them, pumping my fist in the air as the hurricane rages. They roar in return, and some beat their weapons against their shields. The enemy will be formidable, and the challenge immense. But that's what the Bravos have always feasted on. Come on, then, Kraken! We are ready!"

He's very close. After several days apart, it'll be cool to roll around in the snow together. A little slide, and a little somersault for the sake of it... I suddenly realize that I haven't thought at all about what I'm going to do with the Mana that Boo is bringing me. How about another water park like the one the Lyra created? Nah, one is enough. A ski resort so I can keep practicing what Skadi taught me? Haha, I know I'll be hated if I do that. Hey, you're not a kid anymore, Kojo. Nope, I need to find something more useful, something to help the other Bravos who are following me. I suddenly see a trail of fire streak across the mountain pass, sending up a plume of steam behind it.\n\nBooda! As he draws nearer, he takes on the look of a snow leopard, which I told him to adopt. His fiery mane is burning like crazy, a sign that he's fully gorged himself on Mana. I can build something monumental with that! But before I can put the final touches on what I want to do, Boo jumps into my arms and we collide head-on. He starts to play, leaping around and nibbling on my boots. And as we roll around in the melting snow, I quickly find myself soaked to the skin. I ruffle his fur, and he rolls over onto his back, his flames hissing in the puddle of water forming beneath him. And as I get up, wondering where the Mana he was carrying went, I envisage a giant statue of me giving a thumbs up, like the statue of Rune near where I used to play with my buddies when we were young. Hmm. I think the other Bravos would prefer another water park over a memorial to my ridiculously large ego..."

But never because I had a nap in the middle of a run. All that to say that I'd really like it if the flaming rabbit I'm following would decide to take a nap. But nope, it just keeps jumping and jumping, and I can't catch it. But that's kind of the point: to give me a reason to speed up a bit. What did Basira call it, again? Oh yeah, a carrot.

What I'd learned from the moral of that story was that you should give it all you've got, and that's what I'd tried my best to do all my life.\n\nSource\nAn old Buddhist tale tells of a rabbit and its friends – a monkey, an otter and a jackal – who wanted to do some charitable work. Deciding to help a hungry beggar, the monkey offered mangoes and water, the otter fresh fish from the river, and the jackal a grilled lizard skewer and some milk curd. The rabbit, having nothing to offer except some blades of grass, willingly jumped into the fire to offer the traveler its own flesh.

She is the daughter of the giant Thjazi and wife of the god Njörd. The name Scandinavia, which could mean \"Skadi's island\", may be named after her. After the death of her father, killed by the gods of Asgard, she takes up arms against them to seek vengeance. But the Aesir, aware of her just cause, pardon her rebellion and offer her suitable compensation, including placing Thjazi's eyes in the sky in the form of stars shining in the heavens."

He put a calloused hand on my shoulder as I shivered from the cold and from fear in the cockpit of the airship. He had taken it on himself to make wisecracks, tell me bawdy jokes and congratulate me on having held on until help arrived... to have survived. It wasn't what I wanted to hear back then. It made my guts feel all twisted inside. He had noticed, of course. Abandoning his flippant air for a moment, he had put his arms around me and said – clumsily, of course – that it wasn't my fault, that I didn't have to feel guilty. He meant well. And strangely enough, here I am thinking about him again decades later. Watching the troops around the fire, huddling close together to try and keep warm, I sense that they could do with a bit of his swagger right now.\n\nInstinctively, his Eidolon is there among us, laughing at our sullen attitudes. He looks defiantly at the group, sticks out his chest, and dishes out some heavy slaps on the backs of the listless adventurers. He boasts that, in his time, no Bravos would ever have given in to despair. Met with grumbles, he then proceeds to recount his extraordinary exploits, which he has had fully tattooed on his bulging biceps. With much bombast and in great detail, he talks about the storming of Vedren, the defeat of Mezzaren... While some Bravos just shake their heads, others listen fascinated to the old man's exaggerated stories of bravado. Even as their protests fly, I know that the old Seiringar has achieved his goal. By firing everyone up, he's warmed their bodies, and that helps them to endure the cold. The last time I saw him, almost a decade ago, I felt that his spirits had been crushed after not being chosen to join the Corps. But perhaps having him here among us now, through me, was the tribute I always wanted to pay him..."

            "text": "I remember Shahram and his booming voice. The old veteran was sitting next to me. He put a calloused hand on my shoulder as I shivered from the cold and from fear in the cockpit of the airship. He had taken it on himself to make wisecracks, tell me bawdy jokes and congratulate me on having held on until help arrived... to have survived. It wasn't what I wanted to hear back then. It made my guts feel all twisted inside. He had noticed, of course. Abandoning his flippant air for a moment, he had put his arms around me and said – clumsily, of course – that it wasn't my fault, that I didn't have to feel guilty. He meant well. And strangely enough, here I am thinking about him again decades later. Watching the troops around the fire, huddling close together to try and keep warm, I sense that they could do with a bit of his swagger right now.\n\nInstinctively, his Eidolon is there among us, laughing at our sullen attitudes. He looks defiantly at the group, sticks out his chest, and dishes out some heavy slaps on the backs of the listless adventurers. He boasts that, in his time, no Bravos would ever have given in to despair. Met with grumbles, he then proceeds to recount his extraordinary exploits, which he has had fully tattooed on his bulging biceps. With much bombast and in great detail, he talks about the storming of Vedren, the defeat of Mezzaren... While some Bravos just shake their heads, others listen fascinated to the old man's exaggerated stories of bravado. Even as their protests fly, I know that the old Seiringar has achieved his goal. By firing everyone up, he's warmed their bodies, and that helps them to endure the cold. The last time I saw him, almost a decade ago, I felt that his spirits had been crushed after not being chosen to join the Corps. But perhaps having him here among us now, through me, was the tribute I always wanted to pay him..."

Where the Alterers had cleared a path to climb the steep slope is now nothing more than a white carpet. But there isn't a moment to lose, so I start searching. I sink my probe into the frozen blanket and feel it go deep. Then I move forward a few steps and do it once more. Again, nothing. It's been over five minutes since we arrived, ten since the avalanche hit. And the minutes keep ticking away. I pierce the thick layer of packed snow again and suddenly feel some resistance. I take off my glove and use my fingers to whistle. Almost immediately, Chaghagan arrives at my side, shovel in hand and leaving deep furrows in the snow from his heavy steps. I show him where to dig, and then I continue with my assigned task.\n\nThe probe goes down again and again. I climb the slope and occasionally glance behind me. Chagha is digging. A few feet above our heads, the Axiom engineer's Alter Ego circles and beeps. Time seems to be standing still, yet also moving faster than grains of sand from a broken hourglass. Luckily for us, the Alter Ego had managed to drop beacons to indicate the approximate whereabouts of victims. Otherwise, their fate would have been sealed much earlier. Chagha finally digs something up. It looks like a small animal with white fur. Probably one of the region's local species. I clench my teeth to keep from cursing. I'd hoped we had found one of our own. Chaghagan takes the animal he's just freed, revealing another just underneath, which shakes itself off. I can't help smiling as I notice the Trailblazer's mop of pink hair, and I wonder what bet he lost to have had to dye it that color..."

Where the Alterers had cleared a path to climb the steep slope is now nothing more than a white carpet. But there isn't a moment to lose, so I start searching. I sink my probe into the frozen blanket and feel it go deep. Then I move forward a few steps and do it once more. Again, nothing. It's been over five minutes since we arrived, ten since the avalanche hit. And the minutes keep ticking away. I pierce the thick layer of packed snow again and suddenly feel some resistance. I take off my glove and use my fingers to whistle. Almost immediately, Chaghagan arrives at my side, shovel in hand and leaving deep furrows in the snow from his heavy steps. I show him where to dig, and then I continue with my assigned task.\n\nThe probe goes down again and again. I climb the slope and occasionally glance behind me. Chagha is digging. A few feet above our heads, the Axiom engineer's Alter Ego circles and beeps. Time seems to be standing still, yet also moving faster than grains of sand from a broken hourglass. Luckily for us, the Alter Ego had managed to drop beacons to indicate the approximate whereabouts of victims. Otherwise, their fate would have been sealed much earlier. Chagha finally digs something up. It looks like a small animal with white fur. Probably one of the region's local species. I clench my teeth to keep from cursing. I'd hoped we had found one of our own. Chaghagan takes the animal he's just freed, revealing another just underneath, which shakes itself off. I can't help smiling as I notice the Trailblazer's mop of pink hair, and I wonder what bet he lost to have had to dye it that color..."

Not far from me, Catriona is summoning the idea of heat itself to warm up an Ordis recruit. I feel a warm air current caress my face and start to dream of a hot place to relax my muscles, like I saw those damned Lyra doing just yesterday. Ha! I suddenly feel exhausted from the extra effort we've had to put in, barely a few hours after returning from the expedition. We didn't even have time to rest or finish our bowl of soup... But I don't regret answering the call, considering all the people we're saving. That obviously justifies the extra soreness we'll feel after this ordeal.\n\nAs I watch the Bravos rescuer, I wonder where her younger sister Aoife is. Maybe she was deployed on the western flank to help or guide the little Brassbug army that was dropped from the Ouroboros? Or did she stay onboard? Whereas Aoife is an experienced adventurer who can sometimes take a few too many risks, Cat radiates kindness and generosity. And with Aoife's tendency to rush in, having someone to take care of minor wounds once the job is done is a great help. They are certainly polar opposites. But they also clearly complement each other. That was evident at the start of their training, and it's still the case. I smile in spite of everything. With Chagha, solid and taciturn as a rock, and Cat, dedicated and always calm, it seems my little protégé is in good hands."

Not far from me, Catriona is summoning the idea of heat itself to warm up an Ordis recruit. I feel a warm air current caress my face and start to dream of a hot place to relax my muscles, like I saw those damned Lyra doing just yesterday. Ha! I suddenly feel exhausted from the extra effort we've had to put in, barely a few hours after returning from the expedition. We didn't even have time to rest or finish our bowl of soup... But I don't regret answering the call, considering all the people we're saving. That obviously justifies the extra soreness we'll feel after this ordeal.\n\nAs I watch the Bravos rescuer, I wonder where her younger sister Aoife is. Maybe she was deployed on the western flank to help or guide the little Brassbug army that was dropped from the Ouroboros? Or did she stay onboard? Whereas Aoife is an experienced adventurer who can sometimes take a few too many risks, Cat radiates kindness and generosity. And with Aoife's tendency to rush in, having someone to take care of minor wounds once the job is done is a great help. They are certainly polar opposites. But they also clearly complement each other. That was evident at the start of their training, and it's still the case. I smile in spite of everything. With Chagha, solid and taciturn as a rock, and Cat, dedicated and always calm, it seems my little protégé is in good hands."

My blade rests along my body. This is all part of the ritual, of the dueling game we play. As Tomoe told me: The fight always starts in the opponents' heads. Having claimed victory over each champion of the fencing schools, Gericht had established himself as the master of his discipline. He slowly unsheathes two of his sabers, then remains motionless. I try to read his mind, watching each of his tensing muscles to work out how he'll attack. Then, before I can understand how, he's already upon me, drawing circles with his weapons. It's his signature attack! Ember! I jump back at the very last moment, but he's already there to intercept me where I land. I survive only because of a reflex dodge, which forces me to jump to one side.\n\nI can't let myself be pushed around. Taking advantage of the natural imbalance of my body, I turn around and immediately counterattack, preparing to slash him with the edge of my blade. But my sword just finds his. There's another clash of metal, then a feint. I'm reading his moves, and he reads mine. We settle into a bout of sparring as we try to land blows on each other. It seems to last forever. I face some unexpected combos, which I just barely manage to counter. Gericht is a virtuoso, a master of the steel dance. But how do I seize the upper hand? For a moment, I consider using my secret strike, but I resist the temptation and dismiss the idea. I don't need it yet. I want to know how long I can last. I face attack after attack. I suddenly spot a gap in his guard. But is that really what it is?"

My blade rests along my body. This is all part of the ritual, of the dueling game we play. As Tomoe told me: The fight always starts in the opponents' heads. Having claimed victory over each champion of the fencing schools, Gericht had established himself as the master of his discipline. He slowly unsheathes two of his sabers, then remains motionless. I try to read his mind, watching each of his tensing muscles to work out how he'll attack. Then, before I can understand how, he's already upon me, drawing circles with his weapons. It's his signature attack! Ember! I jump back at the very last moment, but he's already there to intercept me where I land. I survive only because of a reflex dodge, which forces me to jump to one side.\n\nI can't let myself be pushed around. Taking advantage of the natural imbalance of my body, I turn around and immediately counterattack, preparing to slash him with the edge of my blade. But my sword just finds his. There's another clash of metal, then a feint. I'm reading his moves, and he reads mine. We settle into a bout of sparring as we try to land blows on each other. It seems to last forever. I face some unexpected combos, which I just barely manage to counter. Gericht is a virtuoso, a master of the steel dance. But how do I seize the upper hand? For a moment, I consider using my secret strike, but I resist the temptation and dismiss the idea. I don't need it yet. I want to know how long I can last. I face attack after attack. I suddenly spot a gap in his guard. But is that really what it is?"

My whole body is tense from trying to maintain my balance as the Akhlut breaks through the ice with violent blows with its snout. Easy now, don't you know you have an old woman on your back? I feel a certain relief when our guide points to the shoreline. I catch myself sighing. It will feel good to drop my bag on the shore after this sea voyage. With a final ominous crack, the Akhlut climbs onto the shore. I need no encouragement to climb down from the saddle. I crack my back and take a few steps to loosen my aching thighs. As I pet the neck of my mount, I watch its head becoming slimmer as it shakes, and I step back, fascinated as I watch it slowly transform.\n\nThe smooth skin of the sea mammal gradually develops patches of bushy hair, which slowly turns into dense black and white fur. Its fins extend and become muscular legs with claws. It stands up and starts to walk across the snow. And all around, the rest of the pack also transforms from aquatic creatures to land mammals. I mutter to myself. I shouldn't be getting absorbed in this spectacle – I've got work to do. It seems Filiki passed his bad habits on to me. I go to find our guide, who is petting the muzzle of his own Akhlut. The animal raises its head as I approach. I reach into my bag for the sextant that will help us calculate the route taken by the Ouroboros. OK, just a few more days and then we can all collapse in the mess hall for a well-deserved rest.\n\nSource\nThe Akhlut is a creature from Inuit mythology. This composite animal is an orca that takes the form of a wolf when on land. It is sometimes depicted as a wolf-orca hybrid that can shapeshift easily between the two based on the situation. Legends about the creature arose when hunters noticed wolf tracks disappearing into the sea or at the edges of watering holes, as if they had dived in. Among the Inuit, Akhluts are said to be very fierce and will hunt down humans who venture too far off the beaten path."

My whole body is tense from trying to maintain my balance as the Akhlut breaks through the ice with violent blows with its snout. Easy now, don't you know you have an old woman on your back? I feel a certain relief when our guide points to the shoreline. I catch myself sighing. It will feel good to drop my bag on the shore after this sea voyage. With a final ominous crack, the Akhlut climbs onto the shore. I need no encouragement to climb down from the saddle. I crack my back and take a few steps to loosen my aching thighs. As I pet the neck of my mount, I watch its head becoming slimmer as it shakes, and I step back, fascinated as I watch it slowly transform.\n\nThe smooth skin of the sea mammal gradually develops patches of bushy hair, which slowly turns into dense black and white fur. Its fins extend and become muscular legs with claws. It stands up and starts to walk across the snow. And all around, the rest of the pack also transforms from aquatic creatures to land mammals. I mutter to myself. I shouldn't be getting absorbed in this spectacle – I've got work to do. It seems Filiki passed his bad habits on to me. I go to find our guide, who is petting the muzzle of his own Akhlut. The animal raises its head as I approach. I reach into my bag for the sextant that will help us calculate the route taken by the Ouroboros. OK, just a few more days and then we can all collapse in the mess hall for a well-deserved rest.\n\nSource\nThe Akhlut is a creature from Inuit mythology. This composite animal is an orca that takes the form of a wolf when on land. It is sometimes depicted as a wolf-orca hybrid that can shapeshift easily between the two based on the situation. Legends about the creature arose when hunters noticed wolf tracks disappearing into the sea or at the edges of watering holes, as if they had dived in. Among the Inuit, Akhluts are said to be very fierce and will hunt down humans who venture too far off the beaten path."

The quaking becomes a rumble as the figure grows larger and larger and takes on the shape of a wolf. Then a huge fang-filled maw opens as the Amarok materializes in all its glory and voracious hunger. It could swallow me whole, in a single mouthful. It looks a bit like the Big Bad Wolf. I glance at the Altrunner's side. I had told Kojo not to call on her, but he just did as he pleased. Now she must not flinch. If we want the Amarok to focus on the Belisenki, she must not even blink. Just then I hear the brazen one give the order to this Cathal to run away. I clench my teeth. Might as well have painted a target on her back!\n\nLosing interest in our enemies, the Amarok starts charging through the pines, flattening them like stalks of wheat. As it runs, the wolf assumes gigantic proportions while its fur becomes covered with a thin layer of frost. Its stare is opalescent, its canine teeth are the size of a grown human. Kojo's Eidolon speeds up as much as she can in the snow, using the trees for support and Alteration to push her forward. But all her efforts are in vain. The beast with its oversized legs catches up to her in a single stride, lips curled up in a carnivorous grin. There's a snap of teeth chomping down, and I have to force myself not to look away. The tracer had dashed to a tree trunk then leapt into the air, luckily landing on the wolf's fur. I shake my head. Besides failing to eliminate the Belasenka threat, now I also had to prevent Kojo's Eidolon from winding up as a light snack.\n\nSource\nThe Amarok is a giant creature that features in Inuit mythology. Amarok means \"wolf spirit\". Although it stalks people foolish enough to hunt alone, it also works to maintain balance in the environment: Its wolf brothers keep caribou herds healthy, which is essential for human survival, by eliminating the weaker animals. Legend says that the first woman asked the god of the sky, Kaila, for a way to stop the caribou herds from getting weaker. The god asked the Amarok to tell its wolf brothers to eat the weak or sick caribous to ensure that the species would be strong and healthy."

The quaking becomes a rumble as the figure grows larger and larger and takes on the shape of a wolf. Then a huge fang-filled maw opens as the Amarok materializes in all its glory and voracious hunger. It could swallow me whole, in a single mouthful. It looks a bit like the Big Bad Wolf. I glance at the Altrunner's side. I had told Kojo not to call on her, but he just did as he pleased. Now she must not flinch. If we want the Amarok to focus on the Belisenki, she must not even blink. Just then I hear the brazen one give the order to this Cathal to run away. I clench my teeth. Might as well have painted a target on her back!\n\nLosing interest in our enemies, the Amarok starts charging through the pines, flattening them like stalks of wheat. As it runs, the wolf assumes gigantic proportions while its fur becomes covered with a thin layer of frost. Its stare is opalescent, its canine teeth are the size of a grown human. Kojo's Eidolon speeds up as much as she can in the snow, using the trees for support and Alteration to push her forward. But all her efforts are in vain. The beast with its oversized legs catches up to her in a single stride, lips curled up in a carnivorous grin. There's a snap of teeth chomping down, and I have to force myself not to look away. The tracer had dashed to a tree trunk then leapt into the air, luckily landing on the wolf's fur. I shake my head. Besides failing to eliminate the Belasenka threat, now I also had to prevent Kojo's Eidolon from winding up as a light snack.\n\nSource\nThe Amarok is a giant creature that features in Inuit mythology. Amarok means \"wolf spirit\". Although it stalks people foolish enough to hunt alone, it also works to maintain balance in the environment: Its wolf brothers keep caribou herds healthy, which is essential for human survival, by eliminating the weaker animals. Legend says that the first woman asked the god of the sky, Kaila, for a way to stop the caribou herds from getting weaker. The god asked the Amarok to tell its wolf brothers to eat the weak or sick caribous to ensure that the species would be strong and healthy."

I had barely set foot in the pass when the Belisenki burst out of the snowdrifts, forming swirling clouds of snowflakes. They emerge from their snowbanks with a sinister tinkling and humming sound. Some twenty pairs of black eyes stare at me, like a score of dark threats. My blade is immediately in my hand, but I realize it's already too late. It's clear that they have the numerical advantage. I need time to prepare a fitting response. Ember! My heart sinks. No. No, I can't let myself be slowed down any further. Aurora is waiting for me in her crystal prison. No, this can't be the end of the road for me. I stand on guard, trying to find a way out while readying myself for the imminent attack. I draw on the love I feel for her to give me courage. I call on the love that has guided each of my steps.\n\nLike a meteorite, a flaming spirit lands on my right side, while an intense light begins to shine just above me, dazzling and comforting me. The ice creatures freeze for a moment, blinded, as a figure appears before me. It's Eros gracing me with his presence. Did I just instinctively materialize him? Was it Surge that came to my aid? It doesn't matter. I won't let this opportunity go to waste. The Belisenki blink frantically, and their black eyes open again. But luck is starting to turn in my favor. Two, then three flaming beings land and create a barrier between me and the Belisenki. The creatures hesitate, and rightly so. Eros laughs as his wings unfurl. I smile and am now encouraged, reassured and raring to go. I step back and focus on my next attack. I let Eros make the first move, which gives me time to summon the blazing fire.\n\nSource\nEros is the god of love and procreation in the Greek pantheon. Son of Chaos, he is one of the primordial deities along with Gaia, Nyx, Tartare and Erebus. He was born from the cosmic egg, created by the union of Aether and Chaos. In early depictions he represented a non-sexual union, like friendship. The sexual depiction of Eros came about with the castration of Uranus by Cronus, when Cronus threw his father's genitals into the sea. This act gave rise to Aphrodite, Himeros and the new incarnation of Eros. In both his primordial and subsequent depictions, he represents the force of attraction that pushes partners to be together."

I had barely set foot in the pass when the Belisenki burst out of the snowdrifts, forming swirling clouds of snowflakes. They emerge from their snowbanks with a sinister tinkling and humming sound. Some twenty pairs of black eyes stare at me, like a score of dark threats. My blade is immediately in my hand, but I realize it's already too late. It's clear that they have the numerical advantage. I need time to prepare a fitting response. Ember! My heart sinks. No. No, I can't let myself be slowed down any further. Aurora is waiting for me in her crystal prison. No, this can't be the end of the road for me. I stand on guard, trying to find a way out while readying myself for the imminent attack. I draw on the love I feel for her to give me courage. I call on the love that has guided each of my steps.\n\nLike a meteorite, a flaming spirit lands on my right side, while an intense light begins to shine just above me, dazzling and comforting me. The ice creatures freeze for a moment, blinded, as a figure appears before me. It's Eros gracing me with his presence. Did I just instinctively materialize him? Was it Surge that came to my aid? It doesn't matter. I won't let this opportunity go to waste. The Belisenki blink frantically, and their black eyes open again. But luck is starting to turn in my favor. Two, then three flaming beings land and create a barrier between me and the Belisenki. The creatures hesitate, and rightly so. Eros laughs as his wings unfurl. I smile and am now encouraged, reassured and raring to go. I step back and focus on my next attack. I let Eros make the first move, which gives me time to summon the blazing fire.\n\nSource\nEros is the god of love and procreation in the Greek pantheon. Son of Chaos, he is one of the primordial deities along with Gaia, Nyx, Tartare and Erebus. He was born from the cosmic egg, created by the union of Aether and Chaos. In early depictions he represented a non-sexual union, like friendship. The sexual depiction of Eros came about with the castration of Uranus by Cronus, when Cronus threw his father's genitals into the sea. This act gave rise to Aphrodite, Himeros and the new incarnation of Eros. In both his primordial and subsequent depictions, he represents the force of attraction that pushes partners to be together."

Thankfully there are treats for the staff. OK, a line of dialog: \"During expeditions, I often need a pick-me-up.\" Yep, I can definitely say that with conviction... Haha. It's funny when I think about it. A few months ago, I was a nobody; and now, they're asking me to star in altavista ads. I can just image what Gault and the others will say when they see my face filling the screen during the show. Blah blah blah. I swallow what's in my mouth and bite into the candy bar again. \"To regain my energy, I always keep an Eat Me bar in my pocket!\" Yep, classic. I say the phrase a few times in my head. \"To regain my energy, nothing beats...\" No, it's \"I always fill my pockets...\"\n\nOK, focus, Kojo. I scrunch up the wrapper and stuff it in my pocket without really thinking. Then I swallow the last mouthful. While reading the rest of the script, I feel around to find a new bar. \"With Eat Me, the bar that makes you grow, I'm playing in the big leagues!\" Blah blah blah, and then it finishes with the slogan: \"Eat Me: The little break for big moments!\" OK, easy, especially because it gives me a nice break. I stuff a whole bar in my mouth and carry on eating happily. Wow, these are good, but they don't half make you thirsty! I turn to the assistant to ask for some water, only to see her drop her notepad with a horrified look on her face. What? I stare at her and look around me to see what I did wrong. And then I realize that I've just eaten half a dozen of the candy bars I'm meant to be promoting. Hmm. What is it they were saying about big moments? Big in what way?\n\nSource\nIn the book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll, Alice drinks from a bottle labeled \"Drink me\" to access a garden through a tiny door.

I admire our joint work: a charming mound of fresh snow with dead branches from a nearby birch tree as arms, a limp carrot for a nose, and stones for the eyes and mouth. I couldn't resist adding an old red scarf and a weed on the top of his head to make him look like an old man. If only we had a wooden pipe. After coming up with a little welcome song for our new snow friend, we move off to start a snowball fight. Crowbar decides to be a jerk and is relentless, so I find refuge in a nearby thicket. Hidden between two thick bushes, I wait for the pelting to slow down. The Wind carries a rhythm to my ears, a syncopated melody of small crunches, like footsteps on snow.\n\nI take a peek over my makeshift barrier, watching for an ambush from Crowbar while asking him for a ceasefire. Our snowman is still where we left him, arms outstretched to the sky... I should have put gloves and a hat on the poor guy. But there's now another one walking around our homemade one.  He's the size of a small child. He's wearing a large backpack and a trapper's hat with flaps covering his ears. A real explorer! He seems very curious about the replica we made, and looks him up and down carefully. He's probably trying to guess the family connection between him and our creation. I'm reluctant to emerge further from the undergrowth so I can keep watching this little show. Behind me, I can feel Crowbar watching as well. The little snow creature ultimately waves goodbye to the old snowman before continuing on his way. If I threw a snowball at him, would he join our play fight?"

And those curves, those little touches of bling! Who wouldn't want that hot rod? I toss and turn in my bed, unable to think of anything else. I imagine it spinning in front of me, crowned in a soft light. It gleams with splendor. I visualize how I'm going to customize it. Pompoms? Gold glasses? Earrings? Why not a moustache? Ohhh, I want that sleigh so much, even just for a little spin. And besides, it would be an extra day off for the Eidolon. He deserves it, right? He usually just works one day a year, so he should take care of his joints! Whoosh, whoosh, Blotch and me, gliding over the ice together. My Chimera moves slightly on the wall. Oops, if I wake him, he'll be in a foul mood tomorrow morning.\n\nOf course, I'll need him to help me steal the magic sleigh. In the meantime, I need to put together a plan anyway. Should I drop down from the rooftops with a rope? Nah, too cliché, especially since the hangar doors would need to be opened... I could flag him down on his delivery route and offer him a pit stop with a couple of my special cocktails? Nah, he'd probably shoot by without even stopping. What about placing a bet on the Bifrost? Whoever wins gets the sleigh... But what do I have that I could give him if he wins the bet? I pull my hair and bury my head in my pillow to scream in frustration. Plans suck! They never work like they're supposed to, and it fries my brain every time I try to come up with one... I guess it's a big no to plans then. Improvisation always works best anyway!\n\nSource\nA sleigh is a vehicle, usually fitted with skis instead of wheels. Pulled or drawn by an external force, human or animal, it slides over the ground to facilitate the transport of people and goods. However, it should generally not be used on very uneven terrain, because it's much less practical in these conditions."

Yes, I should have shown better judgment. Summoning Persephone like that, with no respect for the ecosystem, was heartless and foolish. Saskia even called it a \"rookie mistake\". And I knew she was right. I bite my lip as I think about what I've done. Causing the snow to melt, without a moment's thought for the species that had settled in here… I don't know what I was thinking. Was it because of my homesickness and how much I missed my dad? I curse my stupidity again. I must stop thinking about things as though I were still a kid. And before I can stop it, my eyes fill with tears.\n\nSaskia sighs and comes over to gently wrap her arms around my shoulders. And much to my surprise, I let her do it. I'm even happy for the contact. She had told me about the hakupopo and the other species of what she called the Winter Folk. Storhvit had finally recovered some semblance of balance, and it wasn't my role to change that balance and put it at risk. I could see it now: I had caused this disharmony because I wasn't in tune with my inner self. She caresses my hair, and I wonder if this is what it feels like to have a mother who takes care of her daughter. All I had ever known were the callused hands of my father. A sudden sob overtakes me when I think of him and how terribly I miss him. But a negative thought pulls me out of my melancholy daydreams. It's a feeling of animosity, or even malicious intent, coming from Orchid and directed at Saskia. I stand up, pulling free of her embrace, wondering if my Chimaera might be getting a little too jealous…"

As beautiful as it is, it's also very dangerous for the most fragile flora and fauna in this environment: the arctic poppies, blueberries, rockfoils, cottongrass… I hesitate for a moment, but Spike pokes me in the rear. Ouch! Yes, yes, we're going to get out there and help the unfortunate victims of this sudden wintry blast. Don't worry your prickly little head about that. I grab my cane, a big pair of insulated boots, an extra scarf, and we're off on our rescue mission. With my Chimaera along to help me, I head for the biggest snowdrifts to look for those in need of help. I hope others will think of doing the same. The cold is intense, so we'll have to be quick. All of a sudden, I get a strange feeling. Sure, the forest is always quiet after it snows… But this time it's really too quiet. Even the birds seem to be gone.\n\nI continue on my rescue mission, keeping this strange silence in mind. Then Spike discovers the answer to the mystery. He leads me along a narrow path, and as we round a bend, I hear the chirping of birds. Overwhelmed by the cold, they've taken refuge in the arms of a debonair fellow covered in thick white fur, with a bright blue face and a pair of black horns like those of an ibex. The Yeti seems thrilled to act as a perch for his tiny feathered friends as they huddle together against his chest. Sitting in the snow with a broad grin that reveals his long canines, he seems happy to keep the birds company and listen to their joyful songs. Reassured, I leave the Eidolon to bring warmth to the chilly woods, and resume my mission to help those who haven't been fortunate enough to find such refuge."

The hordes of Belisenki keep rushing at me, and I have to admire their tenacity. I'm on their territory. In fact, all of Storhvit is theirs – no doubt about it. All I can do is wait for a brief lull. As long as we're here, we'll be intruders. Yes, Tei has tried to reach out to them through the Skein to ask for their clemency and to soothe their hostility, but we might as well face facts: It isn't working. All I can bring myself to do is rely on my survival instinct – and it's telling me to give back as good as I'm getting. So I gnash my teeth and slash with my claws to pierce through their ranks.\n\nI move like the wind, but they're raining down from the heights, surrounding me, encircling me. So I leap and dodge, zigzag and weave. Around me, the Eidolons that Tei is manifesting allow me to get out of tough spots, but I know that even with all the Mana I've swallowed, it's burning up faster than a matchstick. Tei! It's a call for help in which my exasperation comes through loud and clear. Suddenly, a bluish light colors the foliage on the trees. I head towards it and see a small being capturing the Mana all around. I recognize its smell. I know what it provides. I swallow down the Mana orb it's crafted for me without slowing my stride. With a quick glance behind me, I see it dissipate. The little drop it gave me won't last long in my stomach. It's already half-digested. But maybe it will get me to the edge of the woods."

The expedition has come to a halt, and we're looking for some way to avoid a detour that could take hours or even days. Everyone is brainstorming emergency solutions. In different circumstances, I could jump across using Alteration as a foothold, or bend a tree into position to provide us with a path. But the tree line is too far, and I have to think about all the folks behind me who can't use the same tricks as I do. In my pocket, I roll my few remaining seeds between my fingers. No, I'll save them for a more critical moment. The group is discussing how to cross the gap without having to cut down nearby trees, and I take the opportunity to sit down and drink a bit of water.\n\nAs the group mulls over the remaining options, I hear a rumbling sound from the bottom of the gorge. Intrigued, I peer over the edge of the crevasse and see a green tuft moving up towards me. It looks like a bush. No… it's lichen! A huge mossy surface, some fifteen feet around, arrives at the edge. It's actually the top of a flower-shaped face, with horns on its head like an elk's – an enormous head with hair and a beard made of moss. A man's torso follows, covered with multiple layers of bark from different tree varieties. The Eidolon gives us a strange conspiratorial smile. Its body stops growing once it's half as wide as the crevasse. The being stretches out its enormous arms, which look like tree trunks. Its hand grasps the ground on the other side of the rift, and its elbow slowly comes to rest near where we're standing. I grab my bag and smile back, then hurry towards the makeshift bridge. Sometimes, nature really does step in to lend a hand…"

Her long train is trimmed at the end with ears of wheat, which in a different setting might resemble a viper's tail. But there is no venom in her attitude, only an amiable aura that gradually puts me at ease. As she faces the head of the Expeditionary Corps, she grows a seat of interlaced branches beneath her and sits down gracefully. With a smile, Temera Singh sits down in turn and raises the possibility of permanently changing Storhvit's climate. For many people, I know that crossing the region is grueling, not least because of the harshness of its interminable winter. Besides making progress quite laborious, many explorers have suffered frostbite, cardiovascular problems, hypothermia… not to mention the Belisenki.\n\nI had tried many times to stand up to those members of the general staff who were demanding that this biotope be terraformed. There had been endless meetings about it, with some of them becoming rather confrontational. That's what had persuaded the Admiral to seek the Eidolon's support, to hear her opinion and inquire as to how feasible such an operation might be. I listen to the discussion with my fists clenched tightly. Demeter listens to everyone's opinions, from the most radical to those that try to offer some semblance of compromise. I would have liked to find some kind of common ground myself, but we're talking here about drastically transforming whole environments. I bite my lip, struggling to keep my emotions in check. There's so much at stake here: habitats to be protected, species that could suddenly find themselves endangered… After listening to all the different opinions at great length, Demeter rises from her seat and gives a simple reply. We must adapt to nature; not the other way around. I feel a weight suddenly lifted from my shoulders and I let out a huge sigh of relief."

            "text": "I hum a little Muna nursery rhyme as I dig in the dirt with my hands. It's my little ritual whenever I plant something. Putting seeds in the soil is always a sacred moment. Especially when that soil is so unsuitable for sprouting, when the cold leaves the plants more inclined to keep sleeping. It's important to take the time to clear a furrow deep enough to give the future plant access to the nutrients it needs and life-saving protection from the soil. A good start is essential, because everything that follows depends on the care given in these early moments. I finish shaping the future cocoon as I kneel, carefully clearing the snow and kneading the earth to loosen and warm it. I add a bit of Mana, but only a touch. There's no need to force nature's magic along. It's a slow process, but one that shouldn't be rushed. When the soil is finally ready, I dip my hand into the little leather pouch where I keep my seeds. I delicately separate them in my palm with one finger.\n\nWhatever their size, whatever their shape, they're all perfect. Rin had found them in the bottom of one of my pots when we were taking down the floral tent before striking camp. We decided to share them, like I had done with Teija. The famous beans, now with my own touch of magic... I wipe my brow. Everything's ready. This is the moment of truth, when I place the seeds in the ground. I finish my ritual as the Mana flows through the seed. I shiver as I feel the magic start to work, sensing their Skein connecting to the rest of nature. The germination accelerates, the cotyledons open, the radicle emerges, and the plumule unfurls with a golden sparkle. Though I've witnessed this scene hundreds of times, I'm still awestruck every time. If only I could offer the Spindle Tree a rebirth like this… As the first leaves appear, I leave the new sprout to follow the life path dictated by the idea embedded within it. I move on to the next furrow and repeat my sacred ritual."

All around us, the petals of the floral tent are being buffeted by swirling winds. I was lucky to have been close enough at the time to see her fall, even through the blizzard. And fortunately, the layer of fresh powder had been thick enough to break her fall. Even so, it had taken me nearly an hour to reach her, long enough for her body temperature to noticeably drop. Spike suddenly tugs at my sleeve. Yes, little sprout, I know. I take the kettle from the fire and pour a bit of hot water into a metal cup. Then I sprinkle in a bit of black compost to spice up the mixture that he needs to endure the cold. A strong gust rattles the petal walls and whistles angrily in our ears. Spike wraps himself up in his blanket, looking worried and perhaps a bit dejected.\n\nWe were fortunate to get this shelter to grow despite the violent weather. Our crown of leaves is well-positioned in line with the wind to deflect a lot of its force. I turn to the pistils, which are starting to glow. That means night must be falling outside. Let's hope the storm will have lost a bit of its intensity by morning… There's a sudden scratching at the entrance to the tent, and I gently touch the floral membrane to make it open slightly. Covered in snow and looking thoroughly frozen, the mush I had sent out to seek word from the other explorers enters. Snuggling in among the pistils to soak in their warmth, the mushroom regains its composure and communicates through its mycelium to share some emotions that greatly reassure me. Other floral tents were able to grow, providing shelter for all the other explorers. I breathe a sigh of relief. Now I just have to wait for the little one to wake up."

Talking with this Lyra storyteller is a real pleasure as he seems to have a thousand stories in his pack… as well as thousands more historic and fictional anecdotes. Of course, there's no proof to support the truth of his tales, but it's a joy to immerse myself in the legends he's learned by heart and that he can share around the fire – or while walking through the bowels of a vast glacier, like we're doing now. I had never crossed paths with him in the Ouroboros, but this chance encounter with his expedition had been a stroke of luck and a genuine blessing. Suddenly, however, something catches my attention, and I place my hand on my companion's arm to ask him to be quiet for a moment. There's a tenuous sound, seemingly from far away.\n\nI hear a dull pounding, followed by breathless shouts. The storyteller listens too and furrows his brow. The cries seem to be coming from behind a thick barrier of ice, which is blocking our path to the source of this apparent call for help. I quickly consider our options and decide to call on the Bear King Valemon, who should be more than strong enough to break open this icy cell. I place my Glyphs on the walls, and the old white bear materializes within the translucent veil with his front paws extended. By sheer force of will, he twists and deforms the ice. I step back and take cover, of course. The ice sublimates in a sudden cloud of steam, opening a narrow passage to the other side. Let's hurry – someone needs our help."

It melts the snow, determined to wage war on winter all by itself and visibly annoyed by the cold constantly assailing its territory. I feel my men's eyes on my back and sense a bit of challenge in their attitude. I raise an eyebrow. All right, I'll show them what I'm made of. But I'm not going to launch a frontal assault on this walking hibachi – I don't want to ruin my uniform. I cross my arms and look as indifferent as possible, then turn to my troopers, more in jest than in actual defiance. I signal to my new aide-de-camp to bring me my things, and she promptly obeys. Then, like a matador entering the ring, I take a few steps towards the creature.\n\nI write my Glyphs on a piece of paper and calmly charge it with Mana, like an assassin sharpening his blades. Whispers and murmurs sweep through the ranks as bets are placed. Here comes the fun part. I toss the paper onto the ground with a disdainful gesture, like throwing down a gauntlet. There are chuckles and jeers behind me… I turn towards them, flash them an ironic smile, then whip around to shout at the angry Jinn. Naturally, the Eidolon instantly leaps towards me, like an enraged bull rushing at a red cape… and promptly falls into the trap, just as I expected. In a sudden swirl of paper, a cage forms around the flaming Jinn. Behind me comes the sound of cheers, applause and a few disappointed exclamations. Florets are handed from losers to winners as I wave to the crowd. I can't wait to see my score."

I fold the order in my hand and scrutinize the landscape before us. The tundra and all its traps are sure to slow us down. I can't afford the luxury of moving cautiously over this terrain as I'd originally planned. I need a solution to avoid that – a fast, safe form of transportation – and I need it now! I clench my jaw. Sometimes I'd prefer to deal with everything as simply as Kojo does and just charge in head-first. But I'm responsible for my soldiers, and it's my duty to get them home safely. If only good fortune could be on our side! Though, come to think of it… it can be.\n\nI trace a series of Glyphs in the snow and a whirlwind appears, spinning around us. I order my men to close ranks. The vortex turns a bluish-purple and acquires a scaly surface, with a few golden sparkles as well. It transforms into a group of giant snakes curled around us. Once the first wave of fear passes, I notice that one of the snakes has a rider: a tall woman with eight arms, instructing the colossal reptiles where to go. She also holds a biwa – the traditional lute – and a sword. This is our strategic asset, our secret weapon: Benzaiten. In an aerial dance timed to the rhythm of her instrument, the snakes lower themselves to the ground and load my troops onto their heads, each of which can carry three riders. My men don't look entirely reassured, but I encourage them to climb on. One by one, the creatures collect their passengers. All right, that's all of us. The squadron prepares to depart. Sitting sidesaddle on her mount, the Eidolon changes her melody. A different vibrato runs through the group. Hope has returned to our hearts. Hang in there! We're coming!"

I've trained my Irises to track their furtive movements and flight paths, which are as silent as a barn owl's, and most importantly, to see through their camouflage when they blend into the branches or hide against a wall of ice. That's why I'm not caught by surprise when they suddenly come rushing at us, taking advantage of the snowstorm to ride its swirling winds. Their wings look like those of a butterfly, with white patterns standing out against an amethyst background. Their heads, topped with comblike antennae that resemble tiny feather dusters, are reminiscent of owls, with eyes that shine like beacons in the night. But what I'm most afraid of is their two pairs of arms, each tipped with razor-sharp claws. I've never encountered such a silent, stealthy and imperceptible enemy… They've snuck up on me a few times while I was protecting the convoy. But not this time.\n\nThere's no way I'll let them get the better of the troops and undermine their morale with their constant harassment. Today, the Belisenki will get a taste of their own medicine. But I'll need more than my Irises to pull that off. I glance over at Akesha, who's manifesting dozens of Mana moths around her. If her theory is right, the Belisenki won't attack if there's a risk of harming the insects. And sure enough, they stop their nosedive strikes and cautiously avoid any contact with the moths. Are they afraid of them? Or are they trying to avoid hurting them? Not that it really matters. Now I know I can exploit this vulnerability. I study the mage's technique, analyzing the way she manifests the moths. With my Irises, I can try to deconstruct her method so I can more effectively copy it and reproduce what she's accomplished…"

I feel parasitic ideas in my mind: scaly skin twisting and squirming, as though I've fallen into a pit of snakes. Akesha is still shouting, but I can't hear her. I'm merely a toy for something much greater, something that has chosen me as the channel for its rage. A muffled fury rumbles within me as I become one with the storm. I am the wind that tears, the rain that stings, the snow that slices. I am the cold that freezes, the lightning that splits the air… Before me, an Eidolon appears. But I didn't summon it. Akesha? I recognize Aroro Niski, the cyclone slayer. She faces me, just as she faced the tsunami that ravaged Arkaster and threatened to engulf all of Asgartha. And I realize that's exactly what I'm becoming: a merciless gale, on the brink of devastating the world.\n\nThe Eidolon strings together one Gesture after another and covers herself in Sigils. The thunder roars around me and within me. Aroro prepares to absorb my next surge, to make her entire being a rampart, as she did so many years ago. Deep in my heart, I know I have to help her. But despite my best efforts, something is making me its instrument. The power crackles in my fingers as I send forth gust after gust of wind, which plucks up my enemies before dropping them to the ground like overripe fruit. Yet I increasingly feel the pressure that Aroro is exerting on me. I can feel her trying to contain my attacks, to counter them and cancel them out. Like a machine running out of fuel, the storm I'm creating now begins to ebb."

I can't let this kind of provocation slide, especially not this early in the morning. We all have the right to enjoy a bit of maple syrup on our breakfast pancakes. It's one of our golden rules. How else can we be expected to make progress through the unforgiving cold of this region without being knocked off our stride by an untimely wave of hunger? This constant pilfering has got to stop! I signal to Taru, and we head out to comb the area for any interesting leads. As expected, webbed footprints mark the ground not far from the scene of the crime. This is completely unacceptable! Taru giggles loudly at my sour mood. He and I both know I'm not a morning person.\n\nAs we round a high snowbank, we come face to face with the thief. My anger softens a little at the sight of his waddling, childlike gait. But that soft-heartedness evaporates in an instant as I realize the extent of his crime spree. The maple syrup isn't the only thing he stole! He also took the duty officer's hat… and Fen's scarf! Like I said, it's completely unacceptable. I'll make him regret ever waddling into our camp. But even as I shout to him to stop, he continues on his merry way. I rush towards him, but he changes direction with surprising speed. He obviously doesn't want to listen to reason. I thrust both palms out towards him in a bold, commanding gesture and blast him with an icy gust. He stops cold, sealed in a thick layer of ice. Take that, you foul feathered felon! That'll teach you to steal my breakfast!"

Although the Reprocessor and its drivers are now out of danger, the same can't be said of the Ordis soldiers bringing up the rear of our convoy. The snow hammering down on the ridges has detached multiple blocks of ice, which are now tumbling to the bottom of the valley. I need to do something. Oddball. My Chimaera has already set off before I even signal to him. I watch him fly down at full throttle, slaloming between the masses of fallen rocks, furious billowing powder and shards of ice as sharp as flint. Like a deadly fog, the avalanche buries the Aegis recruits, swallowing them like a hungry wave collapsing on the shore. I clench my teeth.\n\nAs each body disappears under the roaring snow, my Alter Ego drops a beacon in a desperate attempt to help locate them more accurately once the wave stops. I can no longer see them from where I am. All I see is a cloud filling the valley. But through the sensors that my companion has dropped, I see a completely different scene. Snowy squalls are still moving in slow motion, settling on the rocky foothills. Dazed soldiers are flailing about as they try to extract themselves from the snow. We need help, and we need it immediately if we're to get them out of there. Responding to my thoughts, Oddball starts to emit a distress signal on all official channels. With a bit of luck, other teams won't be too far away and can respond to our request for help. But I still can't afford to sit around twiddling my thumbs. Using Alteration, I turn my prostheses into little snowblades. And without further ado, I set off."

He put a calloused hand on my shoulder as I shivered from the cold and from fear in the cockpit of the airship. He had taken it on himself to make wisecracks, tell me bawdy jokes and congratulate me on having held on until help arrived... to have survived. It wasn't what I wanted to hear back then. It made my guts feel all twisted inside. He had noticed, of course. Abandoning his flippant air for a moment, he had put his arms around me and said – clumsily, of course – that it wasn't my fault, that I didn't have to feel guilty. He meant well. And strangely enough, here I am thinking about him again decades later. Watching the troops around the fire, huddling close together to try and keep warm, I sense that they could do with a bit of his swagger right now.\n\nInstinctively, his Eidolon is there among us, laughing at our sullen attitudes. He looks defiantly at the group, sticks out his chest, and dishes out some heavy slaps on the backs of the listless adventurers. He boasts that, in his time, no Bravos would ever have given in to despair. Met with grumbles, he then proceeds to recount his extraordinary exploits, which he has had fully tattooed on his bulging biceps. With much bombast and in great detail, he talks about the storming of Vedren, the defeat of Mezzaren... While some Bravos just shake their heads, others listen fascinated to the old man's exaggerated stories of bravado. Even as their protests fly, I know that the old Seiringar has achieved his goal. By firing everyone up, he's warmed their bodies, and that helps them to endure the cold. The last time I saw him, almost a decade ago, I felt that his spirits had been crushed after not being chosen to join the Corps. But perhaps having him here among us now, through me, was the tribute I always wanted to pay him..."

Where the Alterers had cleared a path to climb the steep slope is now nothing more than a white carpet. But there isn't a moment to lose, so I start searching. I sink my probe into the frozen blanket and feel it go deep. Then I move forward a few steps and do it once more. Again, nothing. It's been over five minutes since we arrived, ten since the avalanche hit. And the minutes keep ticking away. I pierce the thick layer of packed snow again and suddenly feel some resistance. I take off my glove and use my fingers to whistle. Almost immediately, Chaghagan arrives at my side, shovel in hand and leaving deep furrows in the snow from his heavy steps. I show him where to dig, and then I continue with my assigned task.\n\nThe probe goes down again and again. I climb the slope and occasionally glance behind me. Chagha is digging. A few feet above our heads, the Axiom engineer's Alter Ego circles and beeps. Time seems to be standing still, yet also moving faster than grains of sand from a broken hourglass. Luckily for us, the Alter Ego had managed to drop beacons to indicate the approximate whereabouts of victims. Otherwise, their fate would have been sealed much earlier. Chagha finally digs something up. It looks like a small animal with white fur. Probably one of the region's local species. I clench my teeth to keep from cursing. I'd hoped we had found one of our own. Chaghagan takes the animal he's just freed, revealing another just underneath, which shakes itself off. I can't help smiling as I notice the Trailblazer's mop of pink hair, and I wonder what bet he lost to have had to dye it that color..."

My blade rests along my body. This is all part of the ritual, of the dueling game we play. As Tomoe told me: The fight always starts in the opponents' heads. Having claimed victory over each champion of the fencing schools, Gericht had established himself as the master of his discipline. He slowly unsheathes two of his sabers, then remains motionless. I try to read his mind, watching each of his tensing muscles to work out how he'll attack. Then, before I can understand how, he's already upon me, drawing circles with his weapons. It's his signature attack! Ember! I jump back at the very last moment, but he's already there to intercept me where I land. I survive only because of a reflex dodge, which forces me to jump to one side.\n\nI can't let myself be pushed around. Taking advantage of the natural imbalance of my body, I turn around and immediately counterattack, preparing to slash him with the edge of my blade. But my sword just finds his. There's another clash of metal, then a feint. I'm reading his moves, and he reads mine. We settle into a bout of sparring as we try to land blows on each other. It seems to last forever. I face some unexpected combos, which I just barely manage to counter. Gericht is a virtuoso, a master of the steel dance. But how do I seize the upper hand? For a moment, I consider using my secret strike, but I resist the temptation and dismiss the idea. I don't need it yet. I want to know how long I can last. I face attack after attack. I suddenly spot a gap in his guard. But is that really what it is?"

Thankfully there are treats for the staff. OK, a line of dialog: \"During expeditions, I often need a pick-me-up.\" Yep, I can definitely say that with conviction... Haha. It's funny when I think about it. A few months ago, I was a nobody; and now, they're asking me to star in altavista ads. I can just image what Gault and the others will say when they see my face filling the screen during the show. Blah blah blah. I swallow what's in my mouth and bite into the candy bar again. \"To regain my energy, I always keep an Eat Me bar in my pocket!\" Yep, classic. I say the phrase a few times in my head. \"To regain my energy, nothing beats...\" No, it's \"I always fill my pockets...\"\n\nOK, focus, Kojo. I scrunch up the wrapper and stuff it in my pocket without really thinking. Then I swallow the last mouthful. While reading the rest of the script, I feel around to find a new bar. \"With Eat Me, the bar that makes you grow, I'm playing in the big leagues!\" Blah blah blah, and then it finishes with the slogan: \"Eat Me: The little break for big moments!\" OK, easy, especially because it gives me a nice break. I stuff a whole bar in my mouth and carry on eating happily. Wow, these are good, but they don't half make you thirsty! I turn to the assistant to ask for some water, only to see her drop her notepad with a horrified look on her face. What? I stare at her and look around me to see what I did wrong. And then I realize that I've just eaten half a dozen of the candy bars I'm meant to be promoting. Hmm. What is it they were saying about big moments? Big in what way?\n\nSource\nIn the book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll, Alice drinks from a bottle labeled \"Drink me\" to access a garden through a tiny door. She then starts to shrink small enough to fit through the door. However, the key to the door was left on a table, which she can't reach now that she's small. So she then eats a cake labeled \"Eat me\" and grows to an enormous size."

He's crackling with Mana, even though that's left his fur all disheveled like a ball of wool caught in a storm of static electricity. He has stored more than enough for us to stabilize the area. I catch him and give him a big cuddle, feeling his Mana overflow and pour into me. He places his paws against my nose to stop me from covering his muzzle with red lipstick and glitter. Oh, poor thing. Aren't you happy to see me? But I'm fully aware that time is running out. All this fizzing Mana is eager to be incarnated in the world. Yes, little one. Let's go, everyone on stage! It's showtime!\n\nOur hug is a release, an explosion. I let my spirit wander and let my imagination flow out of me like wine from a wineskin. The newly freed ideas swirl out of my psyche. It's like a detonation, a shock wave that spreads out for miles around. And all around, I feel reality changing, transforming under the will of my inspiration, which I deliberately let run wild. My imagination expresses itself and imprints itself, shaping the world as ideas and Mana blend, weave and tangle in a burst of energy. In reality, the cataclysm of our meeting is like a miniature Confluence, but one that's guided and controlled. And my goal is to ensure that anyone who comes into my territory will be captivated and inspired by its beauty. I think of silks, prints, flat areas of color and strong contrasts. Yes, I want everyone who sets foot here to feel like they've stepped inside a work of art!"

Molten lava flows from the cracks, lighting up the darkness with a hellish glow. BAAAOUUUWWWW! In the distance, beyond the mountains and rivers, Crowbar takes out his electric guitar and starts to play a riff so powerful that it gives me chills. The notes seem to drift through the air to us like little birds crossing time and space. I draw on my Ignescence, my inner fire. I give free rein to my inspiration and let my spirit roam unhindered, gathering all the ideas that spring up. The Sandman comes out nearby, scattering dream dust over the expanse. A Cloth Dancer twirls above our heads, suspended from a cloud...\n\nI let myself transcend. In this moment, I no longer exist. There is only the music and the threshold of the dream. I let myself burn. I let myself go up in flames. And when my mouth finally opens, the flames that smolder within my heart erupt into rousing chants. Fwot fwot. Fuuum, dadadum. A deep, rumbling bass line cuts through the night. Booom, booom. The notes spread out, and then… Krrang, krrang! An intense drumming breaks out, beating time and creating mini-earthquakes. Crowbar suddenly launches into a furious solo. The treble notes streak across the sky like lightning, flirting with ultrasonic notes. In an outpouring of Mana, I start to sing, switching from alto to coloratura soprano. All around us, ghostly dancers start to headbang and sway in time to the music. Colors burst forth from the instruments. Fleeting images appear in the air. And through all this, I will transform the world!"

I follow the tracks. As I continue the hunt, lost in thought, the Wind carries a whistle to me... or a warbling to be more precise. It's rhythmic, very repetitive, like a tune you might hum nonchalantly while doing something else. A feeling of satisfaction emanates from this stunted melody, a declaration of joy. I move closer to the source of the sound. Crowbar covers me from the rear, of course. Hidden behind a barrier of snow-covered fir trees, I finally see a sort of clearing strewn with all sorts of odds and ends. A jumble of items lies on the ground: a bucket with binoculars inside, a flashlight, a pile of books with a mug on top... Taking stock of everything feels like an Ordis nursery rhyme: It makes my head spin.\n\nBut it's not a garbage dump. All the items are in perfect condition. And besides, I recognize some of them! Those headphones, that's Tamati's! It was stolen from the camp a couple of days ago. One, two, three, four things... With horror, I realize this is a thief's den. And then I see a strange figure enter the clearing. It's an elegant cross between a magpie and a penguin. Clearly pleased with himself, he waddles around, carrying on his back a pack filled with items as disparate as those strewn across the ground. He's even wearing a hat I remember from another expedition. And I'm confident that its owner didn't have webbed feet and an orange beak. He's probably just dropping off his plunder from his latest loot run. I look at what he's carrying: cartographers' papers, chocolate eggs... No! He's also got the rolling pin that Hestia uses. How will she make those delicious cookies now?"

I follow the tracks. As I continue the hunt, lost in thought, the Wind carries a whistle to me... or a warbling to be more precise. It's rhythmic, very repetitive, like a tune you might hum nonchalantly while doing something else. A feeling of satisfaction emanates from this stunted melody, a declaration of joy. I move closer to the source of the sound. Crowbar covers me from the rear, of course. Hidden behind a barrier of snow-covered fir trees, I finally see a sort of clearing strewn with all sorts of odds and ends. A jumble of items lies on the ground: a bucket with binoculars inside, a flashlight, a pile of books with a mug on top... Taking stock of everything feels like an Ordis nursery rhyme: It makes my head spin.\n\nBut it's not a garbage dump. All the items are in perfect condition. And besides, I recognize some of them! Those headphones, that's Tamati's! It was stolen from the camp a couple of days ago. One, two, three, four things... With horror, I realize this is a thief's den. And then I see a strange figure enter the clearing. It's an elegant cross between a magpie and a penguin. Clearly pleased with himself, he waddles around, carrying on his back a pack filled with items as disparate as those strewn across the ground. He's even wearing a hat I remember from another expedition. And I'm confident that its owner didn't have webbed feet and an orange beak. He's probably just dropping off his plunder from his latest loot run. I look at what he's carrying: cartographers' papers, chocolate eggs... No! He's also got the rolling pin that Hestia uses. How will she make those delicious cookies now?"

Damn, I knew I shouldn't have woken him to ask his opinion! Well, back to square one, I guess, even though many would say I hadn't got very far with my planning anyway. Improvise. Improvise. Come up with an idea, any idea, and see it through to the end, whether it works or fails. But I've been going round in circles all morning, and I haven't seen a single lightbulb appear over my head. You have an idea, right? Something brilliant, clever... I'll take whatever you've got. But no, not the slightest hint of assistance, even when a helpless young lady is desperately in need of some!\n\nGo on, then, move along, nothing to see here! I'll handle it all on my own, as usual... The snowball hits me right in the middle of my forehead, and I (elegantly) spit out the frozen slush that managed to get into my mouth. Then I stare down the cheeky kids who dared to disturb me while I was lost in my thoughts. The urchins look at me with fear in their eyes. But that's hardly surprising, as I didn't do my hair this morning. Then suddenly: DING! The frozen pie to my face seems to have jolted me into some fresh ideas! Is that what they mean about keeping a cool head? I start to smile at them, and maybe my evil-genius grin scares them more than my angry face from a few seconds ago. It always helps to have a few minions in tow. And they owe me now!"

Damn, I knew I shouldn't have woken him to ask his opinion! Well, back to square one, I guess, even though many would say I hadn't got very far with my planning anyway. Improvise. Improvise. Come up with an idea, any idea, and see it through to the end, whether it works or fails. But I've been going round in circles all morning, and I haven't seen a single lightbulb appear over my head. You have an idea, right? Something brilliant, clever... I'll take whatever you've got. But no, not the slightest hint of assistance, even when a helpless young lady is desperately in need of some!\n\nGo on, then, move along, nothing to see here! I'll handle it all on my own, as usual... The snowball hits me right in the middle of my forehead, and I (elegantly) spit out the frozen slush that managed to get into my mouth. Then I stare down the cheeky kids who dared to disturb me while I was lost in my thoughts. The urchins look at me with fear in their eyes. But that's hardly surprising, as I didn't do my hair this morning. Then suddenly: DING! The frozen pie to my face seems to have jolted me into some fresh ideas! Is that what they mean about keeping a cool head? I start to smile at them, and maybe my evil-genius grin scares them more than my angry face from a few seconds ago. It always helps to have a few minions in tow. And they owe me now!"

I admire our joint work: a charming mound of fresh snow with dead branches from a nearby birch tree as arms, a limp carrot for a nose, and stones for the eyes and mouth. I couldn't resist adding an old red scarf and a weed on the top of his head to make him look like an old man. If only we had a wooden pipe. After coming up with a little welcome song for our new snow friend, we move off to start a snowball fight. Crowbar decides to be a jerk and is relentless, so I find refuge in a nearby thicket. Hidden between two thick bushes, I wait for the pelting to slow down. The Wind carries a rhythm to my ears, a syncopated melody of small crunches, like footsteps on snow.\n\nI take a peek over my makeshift barrier, watching for an ambush from Crowbar while asking him for a ceasefire. Our snowman is still where we left him, arms outstretched to the sky... I should have put gloves and a hat on the poor guy. But there's now another one walking around our homemade one.  He's the size of a small child. He's wearing a large backpack and a trapper's hat with flaps covering his ears. A real explorer! He seems very curious about the replica we made, and looks him up and down carefully. He's probably trying to guess the family connection between him and our creation. I'm reluctant to emerge further from the undergrowth so I can keep watching this little show. Behind me, I can feel Crowbar watching as well. The little snow creature ultimately waves goodbye to the old snowman before continuing on his way. If I threw a snowball at him, would he join our play fight?"

I admire our joint work: a charming mound of fresh snow with dead branches from a nearby birch tree as arms, a limp carrot for a nose, and stones for the eyes and mouth. I couldn't resist adding an old red scarf and a weed on the top of his head to make him look like an old man. If only we had a wooden pipe. After coming up with a little welcome song for our new snow friend, we move off to start a snowball fight. Crowbar decides to be a jerk and is relentless, so I find refuge in a nearby thicket. Hidden between two thick bushes, I wait for the pelting to slow down. The Wind carries a rhythm to my ears, a syncopated melody of small crunches, like footsteps on snow.\n\nI take a peek over my makeshift barrier, watching for an ambush from Crowbar while asking him for a ceasefire. Our snowman is still where we left him, arms outstretched to the sky... I should have put gloves and a hat on the poor guy. But there's now another one walking around our homemade one.  He's the size of a small child. He's wearing a large backpack and a trapper's hat with flaps covering his ears. A real explorer! He seems very curious about the replica we made, and looks him up and down carefully. He's probably trying to guess the family connection between him and our creation. I'm reluctant to emerge further from the undergrowth so I can keep watching this little show. Behind me, I can feel Crowbar watching as well. The little snow creature ultimately waves goodbye to the old snowman before continuing on his way. If I threw a snowball at him, would he join our play fight?"

Swaddled in her survival blanket, soaked to the skin and shivering, the beautiful Nyala isn't looking her best by the campfire. Was it my fault the kids had to be taken to safety rather than stopping her from taking a dip? And anyway, isn't she an expert at appearing and disappearing? I try to suppress the smile forming on my lips. Oh, come on. You need to live up to your reputation, right? So I'm going to be true to myself and let my amazing indifference do the rest. I turn around and walk away gracefully and with purpose, crossing my legs slowly to attract attention. Yep, it's disdain. Come on, you don't put wet rags like Nyala and embroidered fabric like me together.\n\nAs I walk away from this sad scene, I let my thoughts wander to the unfortunate woman's performance before she sank below the ice. I'll admit that Nyala had put on a good show earlier. I think back to her confident magic tricks. You could feel all the sensuality of the sleight-of-hand specialist. Her hands traced twists and arabesques in time with her loops on the ice. And in that wonderful ballet, I could see the Mana rippling at her fingertips, generating entrances to who knows where. She seemed to have at her fingertips the relocation abilities that the Yzmir sometimes exhibit, splitting reality apart to reduce distances. Yes, her expertise is spectacular, but poor Nyala uses it to perform the kind of conjuring tricks you'd see at a country fair. She's just replaced the rabbit in the hat with a martengale or a spindle harvester. A sneeze jolts me out of my daydreaming, and I smile. Bless you, Nyala!"

Swaddled in her survival blanket, soaked to the skin and shivering, the beautiful Nyala isn't looking her best by the campfire. Was it my fault the kids had to be taken to safety rather than stopping her from taking a dip? And anyway, isn't she an expert at appearing and disappearing? I try to suppress the smile forming on my lips. Oh, come on. You need to live up to your reputation, right? So I'm going to be true to myself and let my amazing indifference do the rest. I turn around and walk away gracefully and with purpose, crossing my legs slowly to attract attention. Yep, it's disdain. Come on, you don't put wet rags like Nyala and embroidered fabric like me together.\n\nAs I walk away from this sad scene, I let my thoughts wander to the unfortunate woman's performance before she sank below the ice. I'll admit that Nyala had put on a good show earlier. I think back to her confident magic tricks. You could feel all the sensuality of the sleight-of-hand specialist. Her hands traced twists and arabesques in time with her loops on the ice. And in that wonderful ballet, I could see the Mana rippling at her fingertips, generating entrances to who knows where. She seemed to have at her fingertips the relocation abilities that the Yzmir sometimes exhibit, splitting reality apart to reduce distances. Yes, her expertise is spectacular, but poor Nyala uses it to perform the kind of conjuring tricks you'd see at a country fair. She's just replaced the rabbit in the hat with a martengale or a spindle harvester. A sneeze jolts me out of my daydreaming, and I smile. Bless you, Nyala!"

But I don't really need to think that hard about it. If I send them the wrong way, it'll just get the blood flowing in their legs, and don't they say that walking is good for the mind as well as the body? It only takes me a brief moment to materialize a will-o'-the-wisp in front of me. The little pink spark starts to glow in the fading light, tinting the ice with the most beautiful pink shimmer. With a little blow, I push it towards the explorers, and off it goes. I watch it rushing down the slope, darting between the coral flowers like a ghostly soap bubble. If all goes well, my wispy assistant will lead them a little astray on roads less traveled.\n\nThere's something magical about watching the will-o'-the-wisp flit around as it approaches the scouts, weaving between the frozen petals like a bloated firefly. Soon it will start its little dance to take them off the beaten path. Although, there aren't actually any marked paths here. What if they refuse to follow it? Well, I'll just send more. They won't be able to resist their otherworldly allure. After all, this is the stuff of legends. I've used these little glowing balls many times in my shows to distract or captivate the audience. And it's worked perfectly each time. There's no reason why these fools would resist their spell. I actually feel a little sorry for them. They'll be very upset when they realize they are lost in the wilderness, far away from their objective. But that's still a lot better than stumbling right into the Belisenki nest they were heading directly for...\n\nSource\nSince time immemorial, people all over the world have spoken of will-o'-the-wisps haunting deserted places and leading travelers astray. Appearing as small flames without smoke in swamps, dark forests and cemeteries, these malevolent spirits sometimes have a reputation of luring the reckless into danger. In reality, these apparitions could be explained by such normal physical phenomena as combusting gas from decomposing organic materials, or bioluminescence."

But I don't really need to think that hard about it. If I send them the wrong way, it'll just get the blood flowing in their legs, and don't they say that walking is good for the mind as well as the body? It only takes me a brief moment to materialize a will-o'-the-wisp in front of me. The little pink spark starts to glow in the fading light, tinting the ice with the most beautiful pink shimmer. With a little blow, I push it towards the explorers, and off it goes. I watch it rushing down the slope, darting between the coral flowers like a ghostly soap bubble. If all goes well, my wispy assistant will lead them a little astray on roads less traveled.\n\nThere's something magical about watching the will-o'-the-wisp flit around as it approaches the scouts, weaving between the frozen petals like a bloated firefly. Soon it will start its little dance to take them off the beaten path. Although, there aren't actually any marked paths here. What if they refuse to follow it? Well, I'll just send more. They won't be able to resist their otherworldly allure. After all, this is the stuff of legends. I've used these little glowing balls many times in my shows to distract or captivate the audience. And it's worked perfectly each time. There's no reason why these fools would resist their spell. I actually feel a little sorry for them. They'll be very upset when they realize they are lost in the wilderness, far away from their objective. But that's still a lot better than stumbling right into the Belisenki nest they were heading directly for...\n\nSource\nSince time immemorial, people all over the world have spoken of will-o'-the-wisps haunting deserted places and leading travelers astray. Appearing as small flames without smoke in swamps, dark forests and cemeteries, these malevolent spirits sometimes have a reputation of luring the reckless into danger. In reality, these apparitions could be explained by such normal physical phenomena as combusting gas from decomposing organic materials, or bioluminescence."

It's a far cry from the sounds of the Katkera, which was quite the raucous commotion in comparison. Between the chirping, chattering, roaring, clucking, squawking and mewling, there wasn't much room for silence. Even Nutsuwa Forest, peaceful as it was, made plenty of noise if you knew what to listen for. But the taiga is like a muffled desert, devoid of sound. I'm in the heart of the northern forest, where the trees seem the oldest. And something is bothering me. There are dead trunks everywhere and trees that would normally never be found in such an arctic environment. It's as though winter had suddenly swept into a once-temperate region and stayed there long enough to kill off its previous inhabitants.\n\nIs that why I'm calling on Persephone, whose arrival is said to herald the return of spring? Because of the profound melancholy I feel as I extend the filaments of the Skein? The goddess appears at the same time as the stele she's seated on, book in hand, as though I had interrupted her reading. But I know where that idea comes from. It belongs to my memories, when Turuun would take a break. During breaks from our traveling, she would often pull out a book and tell me to buzz off so I wouldn't bother her with my incessant questions. Persephone looks around her, and as the snowbanks begin to melt in her presence, the old spirits awaken: a manifestation of an oak tree here, and that of a chestnut over there. The soul of a beech tree joins them, and they approach the goddess as if to ask her whether spring has returned and if it's time to wake up…"

The woods have changed in the last few hours, with the frozen taiga gradually giving way to wooded expanses free of ice and snow… But it's not the peaceful haven it's supposed to be – far from it. The trees are agitated, and the plants as well. Each dendrite of the Skein that I deploy is met with a hostile shock. It would be one thing if this were just the ebullience of reawakening nature… But no, the forest is defiant, bitter, scathing, as though it wanted revenge for something. I head towards the cries, straying from my route, and the forest doesn't seem too happy about it. A bramble lashes my face, its thorns drawing blood. And the farther I go, the more it resists, so much so that I have to pull out my cutlass to hack down the thickets of stinging vines and branches oozing with poison.\n\nI emerge into a dark clearing, where the Eidolons of the Three Little Pigs are struggling with voracious roots and grasping stalks. The plant limbs burst out of the roiling earth, wild and menacing, and whip through the air like snakes, trying to wrap themselves around anything in reach. I see one of them grab a pig engineer, lifting him high over my head. I hurry over to hack down the vine, and the pig falls to the ground with a thump. What could have possibly provoked nature's anger like this? I can feel it attacking with all its strength, fighting to repel… Suddenly, I understand. This forest was here when the cold first arrived, and it was supplanted by the taiga. Now reawakened, it wants to take back this ecosystem and is fighting to reestablish itself. I turn to the Eidolons, who are giving off a powerful aura of fear. I yell at them to run away and not look back, as I drive back the lashing limbs of the forest."

They told me that I just had to infuse them with an idea to make the idea sprout forth into the world, and I believe them. As far as growing a complex idea like a ladder of ivy or a bridge made of reeds, I imagine I'll need a bit of practice to achieve the desired results. Still, I'm grateful to Arjun for this welcome bit of help. Especially since, if it works, I'll be able to leave a lot of my gear in the shed and travel light. Stepping away from the campfire, I find a little clearing where I can conduct my experiments. Might as well start simple… maybe with a little basin I can use to wash my face by the stream. I concentrate and form a clear idea in my head, then anchor it in one of the beans.\n\nThe bean suddenly starts to sprout at a truly unbelievable speed. Then the fast-growing stems and leaves intertwine, forming a sort of jug made of plant matter. Maybe I didn't get the original idea quite right? I dip the container into the stream, breaking through the thin crust of ice to reach the water below. I can see that it's fairly watertight, although a few thin streams of water are leaking out between the network of stems that make up its whole surface. It's acceptable, but flawed. Let's see how I manage with my second try. As I look through my possessions, I suddenly realize that my tent is the one item that takes up the most space and weight in my pack. Could that work? I throw down the second bean, imagining what a tent made of leaves and petals might look like. If this attempt works out well, I'll be sure to show Arjun the results of my experiments to thank them for this gift."

I make these little jokes to calm my anxiety because this taiga makes me nervous. I've been sensing all kinds of hidden presences today – while I was fishing, while I was grilling my meager catch, and then when we set off again. It feels like something huge came through here, between the tall pines and the sequoias, leaving a wake behind it in the form of an intense cold. It must have been a formidable presence, because it displaced all kinds of animals as it passed through, and they're just now starting to come back as its essence gradually fades. But with them have also come... other things. I feel a hot prickle on the back of my neck. And I know what that means: We are being watched. I have to stop myself from looking back every couple of minutes.\n\nThe terrain seems to open up before us, revealing a hilly clearing, still surrounded by gigantic trees, including firs and birches with cracked trunks. Seems like a good time to tackle this situation head-on. We stop for a moment and I peer into the woods. Suspicious rustling, branches moving on their own… The atmosphere is tense. The other presence, still as strong as ever, seems to be keeping the spies back as long as we remain in its wake. With a bit of Mana to help me, I close my eyes and open my mind to the taiga. I project myself around the space, searching the bushes through the Skein. My breath grows more ragged as I sense the Belisenki gradually surrounding us. I open my eyes and warn my companions. We'd better keep moving. And we should stay on the trail created by whatever is making our watchers maintain a respectful distance. That's our safest option right now."

Her quarters are cramped, overflowing with papers and books, and always filled with bureaucratic clutter. Sitting at her desk, which is stacked high with documents, and bundled up in a warm but quite impractical outfit, she inventories, indexes, counts, reimburses and orders everything we'll need for our expedition to succeed in the days to come. As well as managing our supplies while we sleep soundly, she continues to work behind the scenes to protect us: changing the patrol schedules, optimizing the sentinel rotations, ensuring that the fires are maintained… in short, all the small but essential details that are completely invisible to the rest of the team.\n\nI lift the flap at the entrance to her tent, and the candle flame flickers in the sudden breeze. And, as usual, I find her hard at work. I bid her good evening, and she replies instinctively with an attempt at a smile, although I know she's completely focused on her tasks. Then she returns to her work, picking up papers and scribbling notes. I wait for her to finish so that I can ask her about my current topic of study. I've recently been hearing persistent rumors about the fortuitous appearance of previously unknown Eidolons. As someone far more accustomed to building my arsenal of invocations through reading than direct observation, I'm intrigued by this phenomenon. Could it be that the mere fact of confronting this harsh winter is reawakening memories in us, perhaps somehow linked to our collective unconscious? Is there some deep legacy buried in our shared psyche? I'd been eager to have this discussion with the nightwarden. She finally sets down her reed pen and turns to me, offering me a welcome cup of tea on this chilly night."

Though they're distorted by the thick ice, I can still make out the shapes of an Yzmir warlock and another explorer, trapped on the other side along the shore of a large subterranean lake. I tap on the wall of ice and see the warlock make his way towards me. Mack observes the scene through my eyes and warns me that the man no longer has enough Mana to do anything more than protect himself from the cold. I test the ice between us with my hands. It's as though it appeared instantly, leaving these poor adventurers no time to escape. And the same phenomenon is now quickly consuming all of their warmth, covering their clothes with ice and frost at an alarming rate.\n\nTime is of the essence here. They're both showing signs of acute hypothermia. While the warlock is still managing to stay on his feet, the same can't be said for his companion, who is lying on the ground, his vital signs rapidly weakening. We need to get them out of there now. I signal to the Lyra storyteller, who unwinds a rope to pull out the prisoners once I break the translucent bars of their icy jail. I trace a rough Glyph on the wall. It bears the raw, unsubtle idea of an explosion, and I hope it'll be enough to break through the wall. I can already see new patterns of frost forming on the surface, a sign that the freezing process is still ongoing and that the mass of ice will only grow thicker with time. The warlock shivers, but his eyes are full of hope. I infuse the Glyph with Mana as the storyteller twirls his grappling hook…"

She raps my chest with her gloved hand, as though to bring me back to the present, but the sound of metal on stone is barely audible through the blizzard. I'm here, Gul, I say simply. I place my horn back in my marble compartment, looped around my shoulder, and look at the defenses. The earthen fort that we grew out of the ground using Alteration gives us a certain advantage, but it won't hold up indefinitely against the Belisenki assault. The ramparts of the fortified town are covered with troopers, and the officers are starting to issue their orders. The fortress contains about 50 soldiers, who are running to respond to the alarm I've just sounded. I suppose it's no longer time for poetry… but for the song of ringing steel."

Her fingers are stiff with cold, despite the thick gloves she picked up from the camp at the foot of the mountain. Her climbing equipment is rudimentary but sufficient. Using great quantities of Mana, the Alterer keeps her body temperature at the bare minimum required to sustain life. The barometer plummets as she climbs the wall. I sense that there's something not right here, but I take care not to distract her – the disastrous weather conditions and the rock's razor-sharp edges are challenging enough as it is. Lindiwe pauses for a moment to look up at the summit and assess the situation: The snow-covered peaks, stabbing at the sky like the jagged teeth of a predator and now covered with slippery frost, are simply traps waiting to send her tumbling into the void below. But as difficult as it is, I won't give her the luxury of giving up.\n\nStill, braving the elements like this requires a specialist's skill, and she's struggling to keep up the pace I'm forcing her to maintain. She resumes her ascent, which grows more difficult every yard. The blizzard blows still harder. A ghostly and imposing silhouette appears on an outcrop. It crouches like a bird of prey on its perch. Redoubling her effort with a powerful push, Lindiwe draws closer. The creature stands tall and flaps its immense wings with a crack. Then, it majestically tears through the veil of snow and freezing rain that separates them, revealing powerful horns on its head like an elk's antlers. It has an athletic human body with wings on its back and eagle's claws for its feet. Pamola, the Eidolon whose domain is these cold and mountainous areas, leans down towards the Alterer. He extends his hand to her. To help her or to capture her? Ha! The ways of the Empyrean can be indirect and winding…"

I'll need to call on the combined power of Phonomancy and Kinemancy to effectively detect their approach and cut them down in mid-flight, using everything I've got to protect the rest of the Corps. So I close my eyes and start listening to the howling of the snowstorm, isolating the sound of the wind by canceling out the warriors' shouts and the clatter of claws on shields. There, amid the turmoil, a thin stream of air cuts through the maelstrom like a hot wire through butter. Over there, one of them soars like a falcon and watches its prey from above. I start to interpret the sounds around me, and most importantly, to distinguish them from the tapestry of other sounds enveloping me… By using Mana moths at specific bottleneck points, I can lure the Belisenki to go wherever I want.\n\nI call on Eidomancy to manifest ghostly limbs, which I then use to trace more complex Gestures in the air. I will tame the storm that they're using as cover and turn it into their burial shroud. The wind that shelters them will become the tool of their destruction. Gust. One of them is torn to pieces, and its body tumbles through the air, carried away by the tornado I'm forming. Ice. Another one's wings frost over, and it plunges towards the ground before being sucked into the whirlwind in turn. I don't know how long I can keep this up. Mana is running through my fingers like sand. I see Akesha looking at me, shielding her face and yelling something I can't hear. I realize that the hurricane is continuing to grow, that it's escaping my control. It's not only lashing at my enemies but also at those I'm trying to protect. And finally, I understand. Something is feeding my own power, triggering a chain reaction…"

And as usual, he gulps it down before I've even swallowed my first mouthful. Below, in the partial darkness of the gorge, the energy specialists are checking the final connections. It was a real song and dance adapting our equipment to the titan's technology, and even so, it's best to keep a small safety perimeter, just in case something blows up – or worse, if the machine actually starts up. Is this the technology of the Ancients? Does it really date back to before the Confluence? I'm not a historian, so I can't answer such questions, but I'm still pretty intrigued.\n\nAll I know is that the titan doesn't use Kelon to operate. Sierra and Treyst had lots of time to study a small inert relic to try and work out how this technology might have worked. And when the guys and I dug out some canisters of honey-yellow liquid from the ice, the two whippersnappers practically jumped for joy. Is it Sun Kelon? A piece of tomato falls onto my jacket, and I curse as Marmo catches it mid-air. As I try to wipe the stain off my jacket, I hear the energy specialists turn on the pumps and open the valves. I watch the amber liquid running through the tubes, worming its way under the ice. A technician retrieves data from the probes. Marmo starts to bark as he feels vibrations in the ground and within the frozen wall. Suddenly, the ice cracks..."

That would definitely be a bad idea. Using my hands, I slide rather than walk to the gaping hole that has appeared in the ice. I feel my heart tighten as I scan the oily ripples and unfathomable darkness that lurks beneath. A young woman wearing ice skates explains what happened. Child. Fell. Disappeared... I clench my teeth. I don't need her to spell it out.\n\nMarmo is circling around the hole and waiting for me to help him. I do what he wants and tap on my Construct to envelop him with a shell of heat. I watch him jump in. I close my eyes to look through his senses, and I notice a stream of bubbles rising to the surface. My Alter Ego looks all around, but sees nothing but darkness. We're going to need help... My fingers arrange and rearrange the buttons on the Construct and suddenly a walrus appears next to my dog, complete with a sonar rig and everything it needs to locate the little girl. Using my device, I send it instructions, then watch it dive into the depths. The animal uses its echolocation to probe the icy waters. Hurry, time is running out and every second counts..."

It's not easy working in this cold, especially on my own. Around me, the Brassbugs come and go, climbing the body of my unlucky Automaton. I tried my absolute hardest, but I should have known it wouldn't have been in its element in this frozen landscape. After one unfortunate misstep, I watched it tumble down the gorge like a ragdoll before crumpling dozens of meters below. I couldn't bring myself to abandon it there, even though retrieving it would cost precious time. And using valuable supplies to repair it was also out of the question. So all I could do was collect all the scraps of metal and try to make something out of them.\n\nOK, almost there. A shower of sparks crackles as a Brassbug welds a new chest plate onto my robotic prototype. It was salvaged from an old armored Scrambler, as was the shoulder piece. But the hardest part will be making a new leg. It may not have the most graceful gait, but an ungainly limp will be good enough if it means getting back to camp. I sigh and pass a hand over its damaged frame. Well, old boy, I promise I'll get you back in shape as soon as I can, but you'll need to help me a bit in return.  The Automaton starts to move its toes and suddenly lifts its head. I can't help smiling, and I pat its exoskeleton in encouragement. I step aside as it awkwardly tries to get up. Good. And when I've finishing repairing you, I promise to give you a suitable name."

Their parachutes open one by one and they fall towards the drop point, a few hundred meters from our location. I watch the billowing sails drifting on the wind and the sealed crates they're carrying. One of them bears the Cornucoopia logo, which means they're food provisions. The emblem on the other one belongs to our Faction, so it probably contains technical gear to replace the equipment we've worn to shreds on our travels. It's not a moment too soon. I hand the binoculars over to Rossum, who also takes a look at them. He had loved walking in the snow for the first few days, until he realized that the moisture was causing little mechanical glitches. Now he spends more time clinging to my vehicle to avoid getting his joints wet.\n\nWell, no point twiddling our thumbs. We should hurry, actually, before the cold seizes up all this brand-new gear. I press the power button on my spider, and it shakes to life. Its legs begin to tremble. With a push, the cockpit rises, and I engage the lever to get us on our way. With each step, the legs test the ground, and only when there's enough resistance do they finally take the full weight of the frame. It's slow and tedious, but tumbling into a crevasse is not something I can really afford to deal with. Further ahead, in the clearing that was chosen as the supply drop, I can already see the metal crates gleaming with a green shimmer. Now that I have eyes on them, I remotely turn off the beacons that help us to easily locate them. So, Rossum, what do you think Santa has sent us this time? His only answer is a shrug."

Cold was the absence of heat, like darkness was the absence of light.\" I contemplate Bill's words as I try to conceptualize what he was trying to tell me. These days, he'd explained, cold and shadows exist in and of themselves. It was hard to imagine a world where this wasn't the case... I breathe out while surveying the snowy peaks, and a jet of steam shoots out of my mouth before vanishing into the air. Although I was relieved to leave the bruised darkness of the canyon, the cold wind blowing outside almost made me regret my decision to get some fresh air. In front of me, a completely absorbed Bill continues his experiments on the nature of cold. I watch him freeze unsuspecting little mushes, then gradually liberate them from their icy prisons.\n\nAlthough I don't fully understand his wild ideas, Bill told me that the cold here was being generated by something, and that it's artificial. Usually, an Oasis is created around a strong idea anchored to a place, and he'd admitted that the idea of cold was strong enough here to act as a repellent for other ideas swept along by the Tumult. But what Bill was saying was that this wasn't a natural phenomenon, that something was keeping the cold stuck here. If I could have chosen what idea would get stuck, I'd have preferred \"pleasantness\" or something similar! Something that didn't freeze your butt off, at least... Bill strokes his beard to help him think, as well as to dust off the ice crystals forming in it. He looks at me, confused, as if something's missing or not quite right.\n\nSource\nWilliam Thomson, awarded the title of 1st Baron Kelvin in 1892, was an Irish-born British mathematician, physicist and engineer. Specializing in thermodynamics, he was the first human to precisely calculate the temperature of absolute zero, the theoretical lowest temperature possible. But Sir Thomson's contributions went beyond his work on temperature. He helped to design underwater telegraph systems and contributed to the expeditions to lay these cables under the sea. He also came up with hypotheses on the nature of atoms, theorizing that an atom could be a vortex in the aether."

It was a bit of a crazy idea to bring the armored vehicle here instead of taking things a bit more cautiously. On the other hand, I completely understand why the foreman didn't want to part with this resource and insisted that we bring it with our gear at all costs. I clench my fists as the Reprocessor approaches the edge of the cliff. Its tracks scrape away the powdery snow and skid on a layer of ice. It's just a few inches from the falling into the void... The slightest mistake, and it could be...\n\nI bite my lips as I see the rocky ledge crack. I pull my Construct out of my pocket. As the stone splits, I tap furiously and manage to apply the idea of sturdiness to the rock. But I rushed it and did a clumsy job. All I managed to do was gain a few seconds... A sheet of snow breaks away from the edge and cascades down below, breaking up on the sharp rocks before melting like a stream into the deep valley. I hope no one is down there. But I can't lose focus. I materialize some metallic struts and frames... all the ideas I can throw at the cracking rock face. At the same time, the drivers of the armored vehicle shift into reverse to get out of danger, no longer worrying if they'll hit something. Far below me, the ground is starting to rumble."

This never used to happen to me, even when I was in the cockpit of an airship. The porter puts down her gear and secures it to the ground with straps. Then she joins me at the entrance to the hollow. I tell Rossum to stay put, and he complies, though I can sense he's clearly anxious. I raise a lantern and start to illuminate the interior of the cave. The walls immediately gleam brightly. Gypsum, ice and pyrite. But there's a light coming from the depths of the tunnels. Suddenly, I see a butterfly fluttering near my face, and I dart to one side. I let out a sigh and look at the porter, but she doesn't seem to want to tease me for being startled.\n\nAs we walk down a damp slope, the walls light up with an ethereal glow. Even though I've never visited the Kadigir, this is what I imagine the Magisterium to look like, with points of light dotting the walls. Bioluminescence... Is it lichen? Or another lifeform? We enter increasingly spacious caverns, and some of them are so bright that I don't even need to keep my lantern on. I approach a column that rises up among a stand of stalagmites. As I place a hand on its surface, I realize that it extends up to the ceiling and spreads out into branches, as if it were the trunk of a tree. I stare at the lights all over the walls and ceiling. It's like a swarm of fireflies or will-o'-the-wisps... I feel like I'm in a garden or orchard, but one made from mineral materials only. The porter touches my arm and points to the water covering the floor of the cave. She's right, it's visibly rising..."

            "text": "I stretch and massage my lower back to relieve the soreness. Making any progress on the ice pack is constant torture. My whole body is tense from trying to maintain my balance as the Akhlut breaks through the ice with violent blows with its snout. Easy now, don't you know you have an old woman on your back? I feel a certain relief when our guide points to the shoreline. I catch myself sighing. It will feel good to drop my bag on the shore after this sea voyage. With a final ominous crack, the Akhlut climbs onto the shore. I need no encouragement to climb down from the saddle. I crack my back and take a few steps to loosen my aching thighs. As I pet the neck of my mount, I watch its head becoming slimmer as it shakes, and I step back, fascinated as I watch it slowly transform.\n\nThe smooth skin of the sea mammal gradually develops patches of bushy hair, which slowly turns into dense black and white fur. Its fins extend and become muscular legs with claws. It stands up and starts to walk across the snow. And all around, the rest of the pack also transforms from aquatic creatures to land mammals. I mutter to myself. I shouldn't be getting absorbed in this spectacle – I've got work to do. It seems Filiki passed his bad habits on to me. I go to find our guide, who is petting the muzzle of his own Akhlut. The animal raises its head as I approach. I reach into my bag for the sextant that will help us calculate the route taken by the Ouroboros. OK, just a few more days and then we can all collapse in the mess hall for a well-deserved rest.\n\nSource\nThe Akhlut is a creature from Inuit mythology. This composite animal is an orca that takes the form of a wolf when on land. It is sometimes depicted as a wolf-orca hybrid that can shapeshift easily between the two based on the situation. Legends about the creature arose when hunters noticed wolf tracks disappearing into the sea or at the edges of watering holes, as if they had dived in. Among the Inuit, Akhluts are said to be very fierce and will hunt down humans who venture too far off the beaten path."

I had barely set foot in the pass when the Belisenki burst out of the snowdrifts, forming swirling clouds of snowflakes. They emerge from their snowbanks with a sinister tinkling and humming sound. Some twenty pairs of black eyes stare at me, like a score of dark threats. My blade is immediately in my hand, but I realize it's already too late. It's clear that they have the numerical advantage. I need time to prepare a fitting response. Ember! My heart sinks. No. No, I can't let myself be slowed down any further. Aurora is waiting for me in her crystal prison. No, this can't be the end of the road for me. I stand on guard, trying to find a way out while readying myself for the imminent attack. I draw on the love I feel for her to give me courage. I call on the love that has guided each of my steps.\n\nLike a meteorite, a flaming spirit lands on my right side, while an intense light begins to shine just above me, dazzling and comforting me. The ice creatures freeze for a moment, blinded, as a figure appears before me. It's Eros gracing me with his presence. Did I just instinctively materialize him? Was it Surge that came to my aid? It doesn't matter. I won't let this opportunity go to waste. The Belisenki blink frantically, and their black eyes open again. But luck is starting to turn in my favor. Two, then three flaming beings land and create a barrier between me and the Belisenki. The creatures hesitate, and rightly so. Eros laughs as his wings unfurl. I smile and am now encouraged, reassured and raring to go. I step back and focus on my next attack. I let Eros make the first move, which gives me time to summon the blazing fire.\n\nSource\nEros is the god of love and procreation in the Greek pantheon. Son of Chaos, he is one of the primordial deities along with Gaia, Nyx, Tartare and Erebus. He was born from the cosmic egg, created by the union of Aether and Chaos. In early depictions he represented a non-sexual union, like friendship. The sexual depiction of Eros came about with the castration of Uranus by Cronus, when Cronus threw his father's genitals into the sea. This act gave rise to Aphrodite, Himeros and the new incarnation of Eros. In both his primordial and subsequent depictions, he represents the force of attraction that pushes partners to be together."

But I don't really need to think that hard about it. If I send them the wrong way, it'll just get the blood flowing in their legs, and don't they say that walking is good for the mind as well as the body? It only takes me a brief moment to materialize a will-o'-the-wisp in front of me. The little pink spark starts to glow in the fading light, tinting the ice with the most beautiful pink shimmer. With a little blow, I push it towards the explorers, and off it goes. I watch it rushing down the slope, darting between the coral flowers like a ghostly soap bubble. If all goes well, my wispy assistant will lead them a little astray on roads less traveled.\n\nThere's something magical about watching the will-o'-the-wisp flit around as it approaches the scouts, weaving between the frozen petals like a bloated firefly. Soon it will start its little dance to take them off the beaten path. Although, there aren't actually any marked paths here. What if they refuse to follow it? Well, I'll just send more. They won't be able to resist their otherworldly allure. After all, this is the stuff of legends. I've used these little glowing balls many times in my shows to distract or captivate the audience. And it's worked perfectly each time. There's no reason why these fools would resist their spell. I actually feel a little sorry for them. They'll be very upset when they realize they are lost in the wilderness, far away from their objective. But that's still a lot better than stumbling right into the Belisenki nest they were heading directly for...\n\nSource\nSince time immemorial, people all over the world have spoken of will-o'-the-wisps haunting deserted places and leading travelers astray. Appearing as small flames without smoke in swamps, dark forests and cemeteries, these malevolent spirits sometimes have a reputation of luring the reckless into danger. In reality, these apparitions could be explained by such normal physical phenomena as combusting gas from decomposing organic materials, or bioluminescence."

With arms full of presents and pulling a bag full of loot, I leave without turning around and with the coolest attitude possible to avoid looking sus. Basically, minding my own business, because the right attitude can get you out of some very tricky situations. But I wasn't expecting the wave of snow that suddenly sprays me from out of nowhere. I shake my head to get rid of the frozen slush and come face to face with a big, burly man with a long white beard. This guy is a real heavyweight! He's wearing a gold chain, sunglasses on his nose, and the attitude of a biker who's been around the block a few times... We stare at each other for a few seconds before I recognize him, and I realize I'm in a bit of trouble. He frowns and looks disappointed.\n\nThen he nods to me and points to the empty compartment at the back of his sleigh. Oh, he thinks I'm a worker here? I grumble to myself, but it's not like I have any choice. I load up his bright red sleigh, which is streamlined like a race car, somewhat disappointed to be giving up the loot from my heist. Once the cargo is loaded, the Eidolon wastes no more time. He snaps the reins of his team, and the reindeer start to leap forward, weaving between the tents of the camp. Then he climbs into the sky and disappears into the clouds, unseen and unnoticed, free and easy. OK, I got lucky there... that was a close call! And I lost all my loot. But that ride of his... Wow, that thing kicks some serious butt. I already know what I'm going for with my next little scheme. One day it will be mine. Oh yes, one day it will be mine.\n\nSource\nHey, guys! So, I guess you already know about Santa Claus? You probably know about his connection to Saint Nicolas (of Myra), and that he gives presents to good little children, right? Did you know that before he wore red clothing, he dressed in green or blue? And do you know the names of his reindeer? Tough one, right? In the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas, attributed to Clement Clarke Moore or Henry Livingston Jr., they're called Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder and Blitzen. Rudolph and his red nose came much later..."

They paint a stained-glass window on the ground, hazy shades of green and yellow that ripple to the rhythm of the wind. I lengthen my stride and whistle as we make our way through the dense forest. In front of me, Kiddo cuts, slices, snips and chops without stopping. Using her beautiful forelegs like sickles, she prunes the thorny bushes and clears a path through the prickly undergrowth. Following behind, I break up the cut branches, releasing their Mana so I can put it back into the plants we have wounded. Behind me, the plants start to grow, bud and flower again. And once I've passed through, it's as though we had never beaten a path through the brambles and brush. As though we had never been there. Now regenerated, the forest continues to rustle with its usual sounds.\n\nAs we emerge into a clearing, I look around and take in the sight. Above the thorny undergrowth, large, juicy and strange-looking fruit hangs in heavy yellowish clusters. Intrigued, I approach one of them. I hold out my hands, and Orchid cuts one of the stems, causing a string of fruit to fall. Using Alteration, I examine it and study the ideas it's composed of. No trace of \"Poison\"... Feeling reassured, I get out my knife and cut into one of them, which releases an emerald juice containing tiny seeds. I sniff it, then lick the juice running down my wrist. My mouth is filled with a tart, grassy flavor. Mmmm. I bite into the fruit, wondering if it would go well with fish or shellfish. And we need to find a name for it. Any ideas, Kiddo?"

His mane of white hair bobs from side to side as though he were reciting a nursery rhyme. That's Jack Frost, all right. He whistles as he contemplates Persephone's work all around us. I know he's pretending to ignore me. It's all part of the game. It's a lesson. I also look around the landscape, as if taking one last chance to absorb the spirits that bring this place to life with springtime joy, as if to imprint the colors and scents of the flowers and trees in my memory. I sigh.\n\nJack Frost giggles and jumps down to the ground. He taunts me, reminding me that he's here to fix my mistakes. I want to snap back at him, then remember he's a bit of a hothead… and he might really blow up at me. Well, more like blow ice and snow at me. Just as I did with Saskia, I look down at my feet and say nothing. It's time to give this biome its original wintry character back. Jack raises his staff and the colors instantly change – first from green to yellow, then to an autumnal ochre. The leaves begin to fall as a layer of frost forms on the ground. The Bickrosts, those little white horned rabbits that inhabit snowy forests, also suddenly emerge. Fascinated, they stare at the Eidolon as he continues his work. He does a little jig to entertain his furry audience, and the snow joins him in the dance. Everything is once again covered in white. Jack Frost gives a little bow. The lesson is over. I turn on my heel, stiffen my collar, and whisper goodbye to spring…"

His mane of white hair bobs from side to side as though he were reciting a nursery rhyme. That's Jack Frost, all right. He whistles as he contemplates Persephone's work all around us. I know he's pretending to ignore me. It's all part of the game. It's a lesson. I also look around the landscape, as if taking one last chance to absorb the spirits that bring this place to life with springtime joy, as if to imprint the colors and scents of the flowers and trees in my memory. I sigh.\n\nJack Frost giggles and jumps down to the ground. He taunts me, reminding me that he's here to fix my mistakes. I want to snap back at him, then remember he's a bit of a hothead… and he might really blow up at me. Well, more like blow ice and snow at me. Just as I did with Saskia, I look down at my feet and say nothing. It's time to give this biome its original wintry character back. Jack raises his staff and the colors instantly change – first from green to yellow, then to an autumnal ochre. The leaves begin to fall as a layer of frost forms on the ground. The Bickrosts, those little white horned rabbits that inhabit snowy forests, also suddenly emerge. Fascinated, they stare at the Eidolon as he continues his work. He does a little jig to entertain his furry audience, and the snow joins him in the dance. Everything is once again covered in white. Jack Frost gives a little bow. The lesson is over. I turn on my heel, stiffen my collar, and whisper goodbye to spring…"

Those who make him angry may even find themselves frozen in place. The powers attributed to Jack Frost include creating ice, bitter cold winds, and wintry precipitation like snow and freezing rain."

My mind relaxes with each step through the snow, allowing my unconscious to reflect and explore a world of possibilities and potential solutions for the Spindle Tree. The muted crunch of my feet sinking into the snow is all I hear… until an expected sound nearby snaps me out of my musings. I turn to Spike, but no, the noise didn't come from him. I stand completely still and listen carefully. The source is nearby, and as I begin walking towards it, each step closer reveals a little more about it. A slight vibrato... wait, is that a snore? Who could be sleeping out here? Behind a tree trunk, I find a young Ordis recruit, stretched out on her back and sleeping like a baby. Not sure that a snowbank is the best place for a siesta…\n\nAs I reach out to her shoulder to shake her awake, I notice something on her chest, gazing thoughtfully at her sleeping face. It's a mush. Well, a Snoozer Shroom to be precise. I quickly notice that a bit of its cap has been nibbled away. Well, I guess that explains the soldier's untimely nap. Another novice who didn't pay attention during their training about the dangers of the forest. Still, the mush's red cap with blue scales should have been an obvious warning. I borrow the recruit's waterproof gloves and pick up the little mushroom, which then offers me a bit of its cap. No thanks, little one, I just ate. And I know all about your narcotic properties. But I'll save it for later so I can make a soup that brings on a deep, refreshing sleep, like certain moms do for their overactive kids. In the meantime, I'll need to brew some herbal tea for the recruit, who'll likely wake up with a nasty cold… What was she doing out here all alone, anyway?"

My mind relaxes with each step through the snow, allowing my unconscious to reflect and explore a world of possibilities and potential solutions for the Spindle Tree. The muted crunch of my feet sinking into the snow is all I hear… until an expected sound nearby snaps me out of my musings. I turn to Spike, but no, the noise didn't come from him. I stand completely still and listen carefully. The source is nearby, and as I begin walking towards it, each step closer reveals a little more about it. A slight vibrato... wait, is that a snore? Who could be sleeping out here? Behind a tree trunk, I find a young Ordis recruit, stretched out on her back and sleeping like a baby. Not sure that a snowbank is the best place for a siesta…\n\nAs I reach out to her shoulder to shake her awake, I notice something on her chest, gazing thoughtfully at her sleeping face. It's a mush. Well, a Snoozer Shroom to be precise. I quickly notice that a bit of its cap has been nibbled away. Well, I guess that explains the soldier's untimely nap. Another novice who didn't pay attention during their training about the dangers of the forest. Still, the mush's red cap with blue scales should have been an obvious warning. I borrow the recruit's waterproof gloves and pick up the little mushroom, which then offers me a bit of its cap. No thanks, little one, I just ate. And I know all about your narcotic properties. But I'll save it for later so I can make a soup that brings on a deep, refreshing sleep, like certain moms do for their overactive kids. In the meantime, I'll need to brew some herbal tea for the recruit, who'll likely wake up with a nasty cold… What was she doing out here all alone, anyway?"

It's a far cry from the sounds of the Katkera, which was quite the raucous commotion in comparison. Between the chirping, chattering, roaring, clucking, squawking and mewling, there wasn't much room for silence. Even Nutsuwa Forest, peaceful as it was, made plenty of noise if you knew what to listen for. But the taiga is like a muffled desert, devoid of sound. I'm in the heart of the northern forest, where the trees seem the oldest. And something is bothering me. There are dead trunks everywhere and trees that would normally never be found in such an arctic environment. It's as though winter had suddenly swept into a once-temperate region and stayed there long enough to kill off its previous inhabitants.\n\nIs that why I'm calling on Persephone, whose arrival is said to herald the return of spring? Because of the profound melancholy I feel as I extend the filaments of the Skein? The goddess appears at the same time as the stele she's seated on, book in hand, as though I had interrupted her reading. But I know where that idea comes from. It belongs to my memories, when Turuun would take a break. During breaks from our traveling, she would often pull out a book and tell me to buzz off so I wouldn't bother her with my incessant questions. Persephone looks around her, and as the snowbanks begin to melt in her presence, the old spirits awaken: a manifestation of an oak tree here, and that of a chestnut over there. The soul of a beech tree joins them, and they approach the goddess as if to ask her whether spring has returned and if it's time to wake up…"

It's a far cry from the sounds of the Katkera, which was quite the raucous commotion in comparison. Between the chirping, chattering, roaring, clucking, squawking and mewling, there wasn't much room for silence. Even Nutsuwa Forest, peaceful as it was, made plenty of noise if you knew what to listen for. But the taiga is like a muffled desert, devoid of sound. I'm in the heart of the northern forest, where the trees seem the oldest. And something is bothering me. There are dead trunks everywhere and trees that would normally never be found in such an arctic environment. It's as though winter had suddenly swept into a once-temperate region and stayed there long enough to kill off its previous inhabitants.\n\nIs that why I'm calling on Persephone, whose arrival is said to herald the return of spring? Because of the profound melancholy I feel as I extend the filaments of the Skein? The goddess appears at the same time as the stele she's seated on, book in hand, as though I had interrupted her reading. But I know where that idea comes from. It belongs to my memories, when Turuun would take a break. During breaks from our traveling, she would often pull out a book and tell me to buzz off so I wouldn't bother her with my incessant questions. Persephone looks around her, and as the snowbanks begin to melt in her presence, the old spirits awaken: a manifestation of an oak tree here, and that of a chestnut over there. The soul of a beech tree joins them, and they approach the goddess as if to ask her whether spring has returned and if it's time to wake up…"

He's running quite a temperature... No wonder he's been feeling so weak since yesterday. I fidget slightly on my stool, waiting for the gardener to finish with his current patients. The otter grabs a pot and fills it with little balls of clay, a bit of bark and some damp soil. Then he grabs the first sentient plant and gently places it in the rehab container. The otter tenderly repots the patient as though making a bed and places it close to a light source to ensure it gets enough rays to jump-start the process of photosynthesis. He does the same with the little Coneman, then attends to the little Sneezer Shroom who can't stop spluttering out clouds of half-filtered spores.\n\nNow it's Spike's turn to be cared for. The repotter otter places him in a pot and pats down the earth around his little feet, then wraps the bundle up warmly. He then removes the wilted flowers covering Spike's head so that the new buds can bloom more easily. Once Spike is feeling better, new bright-red corollae will open over his cute little face, and he'll definitely be anxious to get moving again. He's never had much patience for being stuck somewhere with nothing to do. But until then, he needs to get some rest. As for me, I must admit, a little downtime will do me good. I desperately miss plunging my hands into fresh soil, and there's still plenty to do in the greenhouse. I gently run my hand over my Chimaera's head, which is already drooping from exhaustion. I hate to see him bedridden like this, and I hope his recovery won't take too long…"

He's running quite a temperature... No wonder he's been feeling so weak since yesterday. I fidget slightly on my stool, waiting for the gardener to finish with his current patients. The otter grabs a pot and fills it with little balls of clay, a bit of bark and some damp soil. Then he grabs the first sentient plant and gently places it in the rehab container. The otter tenderly repots the patient as though making a bed and places it close to a light source to ensure it gets enough rays to jump-start the process of photosynthesis. He does the same with the little Coneman, then attends to the little Sneezer Shroom who can't stop spluttering out clouds of half-filtered spores.\n\nNow it's Spike's turn to be cared for. The repotter otter places him in a pot and pats down the earth around his little feet, then wraps the bundle up warmly. He then removes the wilted flowers covering Spike's head so that the new buds can bloom more easily. Once Spike is feeling better, new bright-red corollae will open over his cute little face, and he'll definitely be anxious to get moving again. He's never had much patience for being stuck somewhere with nothing to do. But until then, he needs to get some rest. As for me, I must admit, a little downtime will do me good. I desperately miss plunging my hands into fresh soil, and there's still plenty to do in the greenhouse. I gently run my hand over my Chimaera's head, which is already drooping from exhaustion. I hate to see him bedridden like this, and I hope his recovery won't take too long…"

Yes, I should have shown better judgment. Summoning Persephone like that, with no respect for the ecosystem, was heartless and foolish. Saskia even called it a \"rookie mistake\". And I knew she was right. I bite my lip as I think about what I've done. Causing the snow to melt, without a moment's thought for the species that had settled in here… I don't know what I was thinking. Was it because of my homesickness and how much I missed my dad? I curse my stupidity again. I must stop thinking about things as though I were still a kid. And before I can stop it, my eyes fill with tears.\n\nSaskia sighs and comes over to gently wrap her arms around my shoulders. And much to my surprise, I let her do it. I'm even happy for the contact. She had told me about the hakupopo and the other species of what she called the Winter Folk. Storhvit had finally recovered some semblance of balance, and it wasn't my role to change that balance and put it at risk. I could see it now: I had caused this disharmony because I wasn't in tune with my inner self. She caresses my hair, and I wonder if this is what it feels like to have a mother who takes care of her daughter. All I had ever known were the callused hands of my father. A sudden sob overtakes me when I think of him and how terribly I miss him. But a negative thought pulls me out of my melancholy daydreams. It's a feeling of animosity, or even malicious intent, coming from Orchid and directed at Saskia. I stand up, pulling free of her embrace, wondering if my Chimaera might be getting a little too jealous…"

Yes, I should have shown better judgment. Summoning Persephone like that, with no respect for the ecosystem, was heartless and foolish. Saskia even called it a \"rookie mistake\". And I knew she was right. I bite my lip as I think about what I've done. Causing the snow to melt, without a moment's thought for the species that had settled in here… I don't know what I was thinking. Was it because of my homesickness and how much I missed my dad? I curse my stupidity again. I must stop thinking about things as though I were still a kid. And before I can stop it, my eyes fill with tears.\n\nSaskia sighs and comes over to gently wrap her arms around my shoulders. And much to my surprise, I let her do it. I'm even happy for the contact. She had told me about the hakupopo and the other species of what she called the Winter Folk. Storhvit had finally recovered some semblance of balance, and it wasn't my role to change that balance and put it at risk. I could see it now: I had caused this disharmony because I wasn't in tune with my inner self. She caresses my hair, and I wonder if this is what it feels like to have a mother who takes care of her daughter. All I had ever known were the callused hands of my father. A sudden sob overtakes me when I think of him and how terribly I miss him. But a negative thought pulls me out of my melancholy daydreams. It's a feeling of animosity, or even malicious intent, coming from Orchid and directed at Saskia. I stand up, pulling free of her embrace, wondering if my Chimaera might be getting a little too jealous…"

As beautiful as it is, it's also very dangerous for the most fragile flora and fauna in this environment: the arctic poppies, blueberries, rockfoils, cottongrass… I hesitate for a moment, but Spike pokes me in the rear. Ouch! Yes, yes, we're going to get out there and help the unfortunate victims of this sudden wintry blast. Don't worry your prickly little head about that. I grab my cane, a big pair of insulated boots, an extra scarf, and we're off on our rescue mission. With my Chimaera along to help me, I head for the biggest snowdrifts to look for those in need of help. I hope others will think of doing the same. The cold is intense, so we'll have to be quick. All of a sudden, I get a strange feeling. Sure, the forest is always quiet after it snows… But this time it's really too quiet. Even the birds seem to be gone.\n\nI continue on my rescue mission, keeping this strange silence in mind. Then Spike discovers the answer to the mystery. He leads me along a narrow path, and as we round a bend, I hear the chirping of birds. Overwhelmed by the cold, they've taken refuge in the arms of a debonair fellow covered in thick white fur, with a bright blue face and a pair of black horns like those of an ibex. The Yeti seems thrilled to act as a perch for his tiny feathered friends as they huddle together against his chest. Sitting in the snow with a broad grin that reveals his long canines, he seems happy to keep the birds company and listen to their joyful songs. Reassured, I leave the Eidolon to bring warmth to the chilly woods, and resume my mission to help those who haven't been fortunate enough to find such refuge."

As beautiful as it is, it's also very dangerous for the most fragile flora and fauna in this environment: the arctic poppies, blueberries, rockfoils, cottongrass… I hesitate for a moment, but Spike pokes me in the rear. Ouch! Yes, yes, we're going to get out there and help the unfortunate victims of this sudden wintry blast. Don't worry your prickly little head about that. I grab my cane, a big pair of insulated boots, an extra scarf, and we're off on our rescue mission. With my Chimaera along to help me, I head for the biggest snowdrifts to look for those in need of help. I hope others will think of doing the same. The cold is intense, so we'll have to be quick. All of a sudden, I get a strange feeling. Sure, the forest is always quiet after it snows… But this time it's really too quiet. Even the birds seem to be gone.\n\nI continue on my rescue mission, keeping this strange silence in mind. Then Spike discovers the answer to the mystery. He leads me along a narrow path, and as we round a bend, I hear the chirping of birds. Overwhelmed by the cold, they've taken refuge in the arms of a debonair fellow covered in thick white fur, with a bright blue face and a pair of black horns like those of an ibex. The Yeti seems thrilled to act as a perch for his tiny feathered friends as they huddle together against his chest. Sitting in the snow with a broad grin that reveals his long canines, he seems happy to keep the birds company and listen to their joyful songs. Reassured, I leave the Eidolon to bring warmth to the chilly woods, and resume my mission to help those who haven't been fortunate enough to find such refuge."

Her long train is trimmed at the end with ears of wheat, which in a different setting might resemble a viper's tail. But there is no venom in her attitude, only an amiable aura that gradually puts me at ease. As she faces the head of the Expeditionary Corps, she grows a seat of interlaced branches beneath her and sits down gracefully. With a smile, Temera Singh sits down in turn and raises the possibility of permanently changing Storhvit's climate. For many people, I know that crossing the region is grueling, not least because of the harshness of its interminable winter. Besides making progress quite laborious, many explorers have suffered frostbite, cardiovascular problems, hypothermia… not to mention the Belisenki.\n\nI had tried many times to stand up to those members of the general staff who were demanding that this biotope be terraformed. There had been endless meetings about it, with some of them becoming rather confrontational. That's what had persuaded the Admiral to seek the Eidolon's support, to hear her opinion and inquire as to how feasible such an operation might be. I listen to the discussion with my fists clenched tightly. Demeter listens to everyone's opinions, from the most radical to those that try to offer some semblance of compromise. I would have liked to find some kind of common ground myself, but we're talking here about drastically transforming whole environments. I bite my lip, struggling to keep my emotions in check. There's so much at stake here: habitats to be protected, species that could suddenly find themselves endangered… After listening to all the different opinions at great length, Demeter rises from her seat and gives a simple reply. We must adapt to nature; not the other way around. I feel a weight suddenly lifted from my shoulders and I let out a huge sigh of relief."

            "text": "Radiant and resplendent, Demeter stands proudly before Admiral Singh in a garment made from flared leaves of a bright, fresh green. Her long train is trimmed at the end with ears of wheat, which in a different setting might resemble a viper's tail. But there is no venom in her attitude, only an amiable aura that gradually puts me at ease. As she faces the head of the Expeditionary Corps, she grows a seat of interlaced branches beneath her and sits down gracefully. With a smile, Temera Singh sits down in turn and raises the possibility of permanently changing Storhvit's climate. For many people, I know that crossing the region is grueling, not least because of the harshness of its interminable winter. Besides making progress quite laborious, many explorers have suffered frostbite, cardiovascular problems, hypothermia… not to mention the Belisenki.\n\nI had tried many times to stand up to those members of the general staff who were demanding that this biotope be terraformed. There had been endless meetings about it, with some of them becoming rather confrontational. That's what had persuaded the Admiral to seek the Eidolon's support, to hear her opinion and inquire as to how feasible such an operation might be. I listen to the discussion with my fists clenched tightly. Demeter listens to everyone's opinions, from the most radical to those that try to offer some semblance of compromise. I would have liked to find some kind of common ground myself, but we're talking here about drastically transforming whole environments. I bite my lip, struggling to keep my emotions in check. There's so much at stake here: habitats to be protected, species that could suddenly find themselves endangered… After listening to all the different opinions at great length, Demeter rises from her seat and gives a simple reply. We must adapt to nature; not the other way around. I feel a weight suddenly lifted from my shoulders and I let out a huge sigh of relief."

Especially when that soil is so unsuitable for sprouting, when the cold leaves the plants more inclined to keep sleeping. It's important to take the time to clear a furrow deep enough to give the future plant access to the nutrients it needs and life-saving protection from the soil. A good start is essential, because everything that follows depends on the care given in these early moments. I finish shaping the future cocoon as I kneel, carefully clearing the snow and kneading the earth to loosen and warm it. I add a bit of Mana, but only a touch. There's no need to force nature's magic along. It's a slow process, but one that shouldn't be rushed. When the soil is finally ready, I dip my hand into the little leather pouch where I keep my seeds. I delicately separate them in my palm with one finger.\n\nWhatever their size, whatever their shape, they're all perfect. Rin had found them in the bottom of one of my pots when we were taking down the floral tent before striking camp. We decided to share them, like I had done with Teija. The famous beans, now with my own touch of magic... I wipe my brow. Everything's ready. This is the moment of truth, when I place the seeds in the ground. I finish my ritual as the Mana flows through the seed. I shiver as I feel the magic start to work, sensing their Skein connecting to the rest of nature. The germination accelerates, the cotyledons open, the radicle emerges, and the plumule unfurls with a golden sparkle. Though I've witnessed this scene hundreds of times, I'm still awestruck every time. If only I could offer the Spindle Tree a rebirth like this… As the first leaves appear, I leave the new sprout to follow the life path dictated by the idea embedded within it. I move on to the next furrow and repeat my sacred ritual."

            "text": "I hum a little Muna nursery rhyme as I dig in the dirt with my hands. It's my little ritual whenever I plant something. Putting seeds in the soil is always a sacred moment. Especially when that soil is so unsuitable for sprouting, when the cold leaves the plants more inclined to keep sleeping. It's important to take the time to clear a furrow deep enough to give the future plant access to the nutrients it needs and life-saving protection from the soil. A good start is essential, because everything that follows depends on the care given in these early moments. I finish shaping the future cocoon as I kneel, carefully clearing the snow and kneading the earth to loosen and warm it. I add a bit of Mana, but only a touch. There's no need to force nature's magic along. It's a slow process, but one that shouldn't be rushed. When the soil is finally ready, I dip my hand into the little leather pouch where I keep my seeds. I delicately separate them in my palm with one finger.\n\nWhatever their size, whatever their shape, they're all perfect. Rin had found them in the bottom of one of my pots when we were taking down the floral tent before striking camp. We decided to share them, like I had done with Teija. The famous beans, now with my own touch of magic... I wipe my brow. Everything's ready. This is the moment of truth, when I place the seeds in the ground. I finish my ritual as the Mana flows through the seed. I shiver as I feel the magic start to work, sensing their Skein connecting to the rest of nature. The germination accelerates, the cotyledons open, the radicle emerges, and the plumule unfurls with a golden sparkle. Though I've witnessed this scene hundreds of times, I'm still awestruck every time. If only I could offer the Spindle Tree a rebirth like this… As the first leaves appear, I leave the new sprout to follow the life path dictated by the idea embedded within it. I move on to the next furrow and repeat my sacred ritual."

The woods have changed in the last few hours, with the frozen taiga gradually giving way to wooded expanses free of ice and snow… But it's not the peaceful haven it's supposed to be – far from it. The trees are agitated, and the plants as well. Each dendrite of the Skein that I deploy is met with a hostile shock. It would be one thing if this were just the ebullience of reawakening nature… But no, the forest is defiant, bitter, scathing, as though it wanted revenge for something. I head towards the cries, straying from my route, and the forest doesn't seem too happy about it. A bramble lashes my face, its thorns drawing blood. And the farther I go, the more it resists, so much so that I have to pull out my cutlass to hack down the thickets of stinging vines and branches oozing with poison.\n\nI emerge into a dark clearing, where the Eidolons of the Three Little Pigs are struggling with voracious roots and grasping stalks. The plant limbs burst out of the roiling earth, wild and menacing, and whip through the air like snakes, trying to wrap themselves around anything in reach. I see one of them grab a pig engineer, lifting him high over my head. I hurry over to hack down the vine, and the pig falls to the ground with a thump. What could have possibly provoked nature's anger like this? I can feel it attacking with all its strength, fighting to repel… Suddenly, I understand. This forest was here when the cold first arrived, and it was supplanted by the taiga. Now reawakened, it wants to take back this ecosystem and is fighting to reestablish itself. I turn to the Eidolons, who are giving off a powerful aura of fear. I yell at them to run away and not look back, as I drive back the lashing limbs of the forest."

            "text": "Listening intently, I can make out a series of muffled cries coming from the forest. The woods have changed in the last few hours, with the frozen taiga gradually giving way to wooded expanses free of ice and snow… But it's not the peaceful haven it's supposed to be – far from it. The trees are agitated, and the plants as well. Each dendrite of the Skein that I deploy is met with a hostile shock. It would be one thing if this were just the ebullience of reawakening nature… But no, the forest is defiant, bitter, scathing, as though it wanted revenge for something. I head towards the cries, straying from my route, and the forest doesn't seem too happy about it. A bramble lashes my face, its thorns drawing blood. And the farther I go, the more it resists, so much so that I have to pull out my cutlass to hack down the thickets of stinging vines and branches oozing with poison.\n\nI emerge into a dark clearing, where the Eidolons of the Three Little Pigs are struggling with voracious roots and grasping stalks. The plant limbs burst out of the roiling earth, wild and menacing, and whip through the air like snakes, trying to wrap themselves around anything in reach. I see one of them grab a pig engineer, lifting him high over my head. I hurry over to hack down the vine, and the pig falls to the ground with a thump. What could have possibly provoked nature's anger like this? I can feel it attacking with all its strength, fighting to repel… Suddenly, I understand. This forest was here when the cold first arrived, and it was supplanted by the taiga. Now reawakened, it wants to take back this ecosystem and is fighting to reestablish itself. I turn to the Eidolons, who are giving off a powerful aura of fear. I yell at them to run away and not look back, as I drive back the lashing limbs of the forest."

They told me that I just had to infuse them with an idea to make the idea sprout forth into the world, and I believe them. As far as growing a complex idea like a ladder of ivy or a bridge made of reeds, I imagine I'll need a bit of practice to achieve the desired results. Still, I'm grateful to Arjun for this welcome bit of help. Especially since, if it works, I'll be able to leave a lot of my gear in the shed and travel light. Stepping away from the campfire, I find a little clearing where I can conduct my experiments. Might as well start simple… maybe with a little basin I can use to wash my face by the stream. I concentrate and form a clear idea in my head, then anchor it in one of the beans.\n\nThe bean suddenly starts to sprout at a truly unbelievable speed. Then the fast-growing stems and leaves intertwine, forming a sort of jug made of plant matter. Maybe I didn't get the original idea quite right? I dip the container into the stream, breaking through the thin crust of ice to reach the water below. I can see that it's fairly watertight, although a few thin streams of water are leaking out between the network of stems that make up its whole surface. It's acceptable, but flawed. Let's see how I manage with my second try. As I look through my possessions, I suddenly realize that my tent is the one item that takes up the most space and weight in my pack. Could that work? I throw down the second bean, imagining what a tent made of leaves and petals might look like. If this attempt works out well, I'll be sure to show Arjun the results of my experiments to thank them for this gift."

They told me that I just had to infuse them with an idea to make the idea sprout forth into the world, and I believe them. As far as growing a complex idea like a ladder of ivy or a bridge made of reeds, I imagine I'll need a bit of practice to achieve the desired results. Still, I'm grateful to Arjun for this welcome bit of help. Especially since, if it works, I'll be able to leave a lot of my gear in the shed and travel light. Stepping away from the campfire, I find a little clearing where I can conduct my experiments. Might as well start simple… maybe with a little basin I can use to wash my face by the stream. I concentrate and form a clear idea in my head, then anchor it in one of the beans.\n\nThe bean suddenly starts to sprout at a truly unbelievable speed. Then the fast-growing stems and leaves intertwine, forming a sort of jug made of plant matter. Maybe I didn't get the original idea quite right? I dip the container into the stream, breaking through the thin crust of ice to reach the water below. I can see that it's fairly watertight, although a few thin streams of water are leaking out between the network of stems that make up its whole surface. It's acceptable, but flawed. Let's see how I manage with my second try. As I look through my possessions, I suddenly realize that my tent is the one item that takes up the most space and weight in my pack. Could that work? I throw down the second bean, imagining what a tent made of leaves and petals might look like. If this attempt works out well, I'll be sure to show Arjun the results of my experiments to thank them for this gift."

All around us, the petals of the floral tent are being buffeted by swirling winds. I was lucky to have been close enough at the time to see her fall, even through the blizzard. And fortunately, the layer of fresh powder had been thick enough to break her fall. Even so, it had taken me nearly an hour to reach her, long enough for her body temperature to noticeably drop. Spike suddenly tugs at my sleeve. Yes, little sprout, I know. I take the kettle from the fire and pour a bit of hot water into a metal cup. Then I sprinkle in a bit of black compost to spice up the mixture that he needs to endure the cold. A strong gust rattles the petal walls and whistles angrily in our ears. Spike wraps himself up in his blanket, looking worried and perhaps a bit dejected.\n\nWe were fortunate to get this shelter to grow despite the violent weather. Our crown of leaves is well-positioned in line with the wind to deflect a lot of its force. I turn to the pistils, which are starting to glow. That means night must be falling outside. Let's hope the storm will have lost a bit of its intensity by morning… There's a sudden scratching at the entrance to the tent, and I gently touch the floral membrane to make it open slightly. Covered in snow and looking thoroughly frozen, the mush I had sent out to seek word from the other explorers enters. Snuggling in among the pistils to soak in their warmth, the mushroom regains its composure and communicates through its mycelium to share some emotions that greatly reassure me. Other floral tents were able to grow, providing shelter for all the other explorers. I breathe a sigh of relief. Now I just have to wait for the little one to wake up."

All around us, the petals of the floral tent are being buffeted by swirling winds. I was lucky to have been close enough at the time to see her fall, even through the blizzard. And fortunately, the layer of fresh powder had been thick enough to break her fall. Even so, it had taken me nearly an hour to reach her, long enough for her body temperature to noticeably drop. Spike suddenly tugs at my sleeve. Yes, little sprout, I know. I take the kettle from the fire and pour a bit of hot water into a metal cup. Then I sprinkle in a bit of black compost to spice up the mixture that he needs to endure the cold. A strong gust rattles the petal walls and whistles angrily in our ears. Spike wraps himself up in his blanket, looking worried and perhaps a bit dejected.\n\nWe were fortunate to get this shelter to grow despite the violent weather. Our crown of leaves is well-positioned in line with the wind to deflect a lot of its force. I turn to the pistils, which are starting to glow. That means night must be falling outside. Let's hope the storm will have lost a bit of its intensity by morning… There's a sudden scratching at the entrance to the tent, and I gently touch the floral membrane to make it open slightly. Covered in snow and looking thoroughly frozen, the mush I had sent out to seek word from the other explorers enters. Snuggling in among the pistils to soak in their warmth, the mushroom regains its composure and communicates through its mycelium to share some emotions that greatly reassure me. Other floral tents were able to grow, providing shelter for all the other explorers. I breathe a sigh of relief. Now I just have to wait for the little one to wake up."

I make these little jokes to calm my anxiety because this taiga makes me nervous. I've been sensing all kinds of hidden presences today – while I was fishing, while I was grilling my meager catch, and then when we set off again. It feels like something huge came through here, between the tall pines and the sequoias, leaving a wake behind it in the form of an intense cold. It must have been a formidable presence, because it displaced all kinds of animals as it passed through, and they're just now starting to come back as its essence gradually fades. But with them have also come... other things. I feel a hot prickle on the back of my neck. And I know what that means: We are being watched. I have to stop myself from looking back every couple of minutes.\n\nThe terrain seems to open up before us, revealing a hilly clearing, still surrounded by gigantic trees, including firs and birches with cracked trunks. Seems like a good time to tackle this situation head-on. We stop for a moment and I peer into the woods. Suspicious rustling, branches moving on their own… The atmosphere is tense. The other presence, still as strong as ever, seems to be keeping the spies back as long as we remain in its wake. With a bit of Mana to help me, I close my eyes and open my mind to the taiga. I project myself around the space, searching the bushes through the Skein. My breath grows more ragged as I sense the Belisenki gradually surrounding us. I open my eyes and warn my companions. We'd better keep moving. And we should stay on the trail created by whatever is making our watchers maintain a respectful distance. That's our safest option right now."

I make these little jokes to calm my anxiety because this taiga makes me nervous. I've been sensing all kinds of hidden presences today – while I was fishing, while I was grilling my meager catch, and then when we set off again. It feels like something huge came through here, between the tall pines and the sequoias, leaving a wake behind it in the form of an intense cold. It must have been a formidable presence, because it displaced all kinds of animals as it passed through, and they're just now starting to come back as its essence gradually fades. But with them have also come... other things. I feel a hot prickle on the back of my neck. And I know what that means: We are being watched. I have to stop myself from looking back every couple of minutes.\n\nThe terrain seems to open up before us, revealing a hilly clearing, still surrounded by gigantic trees, including firs and birches with cracked trunks. Seems like a good time to tackle this situation head-on. We stop for a moment and I peer into the woods. Suspicious rustling, branches moving on their own… The atmosphere is tense. The other presence, still as strong as ever, seems to be keeping the spies back as long as we remain in its wake. With a bit of Mana to help me, I close my eyes and open my mind to the taiga. I project myself around the space, searching the bushes through the Skein. My breath grows more ragged as I sense the Belisenki gradually surrounding us. I open my eyes and warn my companions. We'd better keep moving. And we should stay on the trail created by whatever is making our watchers maintain a respectful distance. That's our safest option right now."

We're running breathlessly to reach the edge of the forest with the Belisenki right on our heels, and it's absolutely exhausting. Running isn't my strong suit, especially in the snow, and I doubt our pursuers would be interested in hearing me hold forth on the benefits of diplomatic discussions. I can't keep this up much longer. And the rest of my companions, who are scattering in all directions in a highly questionable display of military discipline, don't seem ready to spearhead any sort of counterattack. We need to stop our attackers and put an end to this rout. We need to do something to turn things around. For a public official like myself, inspiring fear and awe among the enemy is supposed to be one of my most powerful tools. If only I'd been a better student of military debacles and strategic retreats, perhaps I could get us out of this mess!\n\nUp ahead, the blizzard intensifies. That certainly won't help our cause. Unless… The Heka lights up my hands as I trace the necessary symbols in the wind. Carried by the swirling gusts, a gigantic paper scroll unfurls in a circle before us. At its center, Dong Da Shen lounges on a lump of snow, a magnificent blue cape whipping in the wind at his back. I hope that his presence will bring fear to our enemies while easing our own. Ideograms written on the scroll blaze with an azure flame. I remember that the document Dong Da Shen holds is a statement of criminal charges. His inquisitorial voice thunders as he points his scepter at the wintry mob. He's the perfect choice here as he is the god of cold, and his painted mask is the face of winter. Yielding to his authority, the Belisenki disperse and return to the shelter of the trees. I'll be feeling all manner of aches, pains and sore joints before long, but considering the alternative, that's really not so bad."

How did it come to this? The whole team lacks organization, not to mention any sense of solidarity. Is there no one to manage our resources fairly? I have half a mind to lecture them on the virtues of collective management, our shared responsibility for each other's well-being, the importance of planning ahead… but I haven't the strength. Besides, my speech would surely be interrupted by the rumbling of empty stomachs. It's better to save my strength for later, when it's time to take stock. I close the lid with an exasperated sigh and sit down on the crate. Just because I'm not voicing my complaints doesn't mean I should sit around idly. With the tip of my cane, I draw Glyphs in the snow, infusing them with the bare minimum of Mana.\n\nA small gentleman appears, as dry and wrinkled as a vine in winter and as shriveled as a piece of overcooked meat. He wears an ancient, battered top hat, which sits over a severe face framed by a bushy beard. He's wrapped in a moth-eaten, threadbare old overcoat that should have been retired years ago. He barks at me in a hoarse, creaking voice, then gives the crate I'm sitting on a tentative kick – and immediately understands from its hollow echo how much trouble we're in. For an emergency this bad, I need equally strong support. Ebenezer is an inflexible old quartermaster who will efficiently administer and ration our remaining supplies. He's got the keen eye of a buzzard when it comes to optimizing, planning and determining rations so we can all get through this together. But until he's ready to loosen the purse strings, we're going to have to tighten our belts…"

Outside, the colors are fading from the sky, and while it's still light for now, night will be falling before long. Clerks and couriers bow as I pass, and I return their greetings, though I don't have much time for niceties. I head for the main dais in the back office and approach the liaison officer. The young woman runs her fingertips over the letters, deciphering the Braille letters that she receives before passing them on to the relevant people or departments. I cough slightly to announce my presence, and she stops reading. I enter my personal Glyph in her registry, and she checks it with her fingertips before handing me two Paper Heralds. One is from the Admiralty, and the other… The other is from my sister back in Arkaster.\n\nI first unseal the snake-shaped origami and deftly unfold it to reveal Admiral Singh's initials. As my eyes scan the message, I feel a knot forming in my stomach. The Ouroboros has detected Tumult waves coming in our direction, and they will hit our location in a few days. I immediately set off for General Sekifu's offices. It's a race against time. The general staff must be informed right away of the evacuation order. The orders instruct us to immediately head to the Cais Adarra and take shelter within the Oasis. My steps echo on the floors of the temporary citadel, and there at the entrance is Sunisa, who seems to instinctively sense my concern. And for once, she refrains from any clever comments. I notice that I'm still holding my sister's letter in my hand. I'm afraid this missive will have to wait."

A boar snuffling at the ground, a family of hares huddling together in a thicket… all trapped forever in the ice. It's a strange and disturbing scene, yet one with a certain grim beauty. All around, complete silence reigns. I raise my head. On a tree gripped by the same phenomenon, a pair of frozen magpies stare at me in a tragic still-life scene. They seem to have been fighting over a twig or perhaps a stick bug. But these birds will never make another sound. I call Senka to come and land on my shoulder. Until I know more, I prefer to keep the nighthawk under my direct protection. I focus my mind to try and understand how this spell works.\n\nI use all the Kinemancy I know for my analysis, along with the few scraps of Horomancy I've managed to acquire over the years. The flowing energies of my perception disperse around me as one gesture follows another. I sense the harsh bite of the cold – devourer of warmth, source of life. I begin to grasp the logic, the origin, the meaning. It's a magical force that is primal, brutal, yet insidious. It's as though a tidal wave had slithered out of the mountain to strike at this place with sudden violence. With these deductions, I sketch out a manipulation of that energy. I then spot a branch on a tree that's still green, at the edge of the affected area. I cast the Mana in that direction and infuse the branch with the ideas I pull from the Empyrean. The ice climbs along the wood like a wave, covering each new inch with a thin, unbending layer of sparkling transparent rime. Time stops wherever the cold sinks its deadly teeth in. It seems I'll have no trouble reproducing this phenomenon. And I expect I'll find plenty of use for it…"

The orange flames and clanging machines couldn't be further away. Here, everything is white, and silence reigns. I bundle up in my padded coat and kneel on the frame of the damaged Reprocessor. While passing under an icy ledge, the vibrations it creates had caused ice stalactites and heavy scree to come crashing down. Thankfully, from what I can tell, most of the damage is superficial. A few repairs, a lick of paint, and it will be ready to go again. But I don't know if that's the wisest decision. The foreman has given his instructions, but I'm not sure the vehicle will survive the climb up the pass. Plus, its thick tracks have trouble navigating on the snow, especially at this altitude, where the snow keeps piling up day after day.\n\nI look up to the still-cloudless sky. First and foremost, I need to get some maintenance done while the weather's cooperating. I take out my Construct from my satchel and start to reconfigure it. The repair I'm planning will require a bit more Kelon than an ordinary repair, but it will save a significant amount of time. The figure of Vishvakarma materializes next to me, and the god opens his eyes as he spreads his arms. He's clearly the best choice to work on the armored vehicle. With a thin smile on his lips, he sits cross-legged as his tools appear in his oversized, robotic arms. The Reprocessor is in good hands, four of them in fact, thanks to the deity's two pairs of arms. Vishvakarma summons an assembly plan and scans it almost absent-mindedly. He then gets to work in a shower of sparks.\n\nSource\nRegarded as the architect and chief engineer of the universe, Vishvakarma is the Hindu god of artisans and builders. He was the architect of the palace of the devas and crafted all of their chariots and weapons, including Sharanga and Pinaka, the two bows he gave to Vishnu and Shiva respectively. While his creations are mostly physical, it is said that his piercing gaze goes far beyond matter and scrutinizes the abstract mechanisms that underlie reality."

My breathing is ragged, and I pour a tub of lukewarm water over my head to try and bear the heat a little longer. Not far from the molten metal, I see Gibil capturing a jet of lava. He brings it closer to him and lets it drift in the air as he examines it for any defects or impurities. As the water I soaked myself with steams around me, a worker ruffles my hair to congratulate me on my endurance. I return his smile and take the tubs of silica to the god at work. Struggling to keep my eyes open as scorching drafts blow against my face, I set down the buckets and move back, when from the corner of my eye, I see a Brassbug shutting down. I approach and watch it slump, drained of energy. I check its Kelon cylinder and notice it's still almost full.\n\nI place a hand on its head, realizing that it's dying. Some of its kindred will soon collect it and recycle it, maybe to create a new one, but I'm not too familiar with their life cycle. Behind me, I hear the rumble of Gibil's voice, demanding that we bring him something else to melt and forge. His glowing eyes turn towards me and the little shape struggling at my feet. Then, using his hand, he reaches out and draws the Brassbug to him. With the simple force of his will, the god disassembles the little robotic creature. He then takes an arc of lava and shapes and sculpts it to create a new chassis, a wing and new parts for the Brassbug. After giving it a new lease on life, Gibil places it in the crook of my arms as if asking me to take care of it from now on...\n\nSource\nGibil was the Mesopotamian god of all things related to fire, both its positive aspects (source of heat and light) and its negative aspects (destructive and voracious). He was the patron deity of blacksmiths and metallurgists, and he also played a role in ritual purification. But beware his wrath! It was said that lightning strikes were a sign of Gibil's anger when they struck the ground and the fields, or when they set homes alight. His symbol was a torch, which could be held at night to light the way or chase away evil spirits."

If I'd done that while competing, Carmela would have given me a brutal thrashing I'd never forget. Yeah, OK, I've had my fair share of thrashings, I admit. But never because I had a nap in the middle of a run. All that to say that I'd really like it if the flaming rabbit I'm following would decide to take a nap. But nope, it just keeps jumping and jumping, and I can't catch it. But that's kind of the point: to give me a reason to speed up a bit. What did Basira call it, again? Oh yeah, a carrot. But she'd politely declined when I asked her if she could train me, saying that I should just dangle a carrot in front of my face and keep charging forward.\n\nThinking back on it now, it was probably just a way to make fun of me. But I'm headstrong and used to being teased, so it went right over my head, like way over. So, I'm chasing a fire rabbit and happy to do so. It helps ensure I don't lose my touch. I mutter to myself. Gul is always saying that all my talent is in my legs; there's nothing in my head or arms. And the worst thing is that she's probably right. Here, I'll need more than my pins, I'm well aware of that. I need to exercise my biceps and definitely my gray matter. And that starts with finding a way to intercept this damned long-earned rodent. As I jump from thought to thought, I think back to the old tale of the monkey, the otter, the rabbit and the old man. Wait... or was it a monkey, fox and bear? Anyway. What I'd learned from the moral of that story was that you should give it all you've got, and that's what I'd tried my best to do all my life.\n\nSource\nAn old Buddhist tale tells of a rabbit and its friends – a monkey, an otter and a jackal – who wanted to do some charitable work. Deciding to help a hungry beggar, the monkey offered mangoes and water, the otter fresh fish from the river, and the jackal a grilled lizard skewer and some milk curd. The rabbit, having nothing to offer except some blades of grass, willingly jumped into the fire to offer the traveler its own flesh. But, to its surprise, the flames didn't burn it because the old man was in fact Sakra, who had come down to test their altruism. As a reward, the Lord of the Devas drew the rabbit's likeness on the moon so that everyone on earth could remember its virtue."

It's as if the earth has become a massive pressure cooker. I turn around to say something but realize that I wanted to call out to Gault. But he's not here, of course. He's like a thousand miles away. When I arrived yesterday after a long day trudging through the plains, I was told it was Atsadi who had created this place a few days ago while he was up against hordes of Belisenki. I can't believe the power he's unleashed here. They call him the one-armed swordsman or the Cicada of Dusk, and you can tell his reputation is well earned. He's literally made the ground bleed with huge bubbles.\n\nIt's weird to see that the site of such an epic battle has become a sort of aquatic amusement park. The Lyra took over the place and converted it into an open-air pool. They cooled it down, of course, so that no one got boiled alive, and then leveled it all to keep the water in. And now, everyone is bathing, splashing around and chatting... If someone had told me yesterday, as we were struggling to traverse the frozen wilderness, that today I'd be taking it easy in some hot springs, I'd never have believed it. So, while I let my mind wander, wondering if Atsadi would take on a squire, I'm suddenly splashed by a Magpeng and a Tanuki squabbling over who's next on the launch pad. The Magpeng wins the argument and jumps just in time as the ground begins to rumble. An immense geyser shoots it up into the sky as it screams with laughter."

I kick myself for having taken this path, which has turned out to be a dead end. It's what I deserve for playing tricks on those poor wretches the other day or criticizing Nyala's powers, which I could really use right about now. This is definitely karma. But I have more than one trick up my sleeve. There's a key for every door! And if not, I can always make one! Heimdall is the perfect candidate for this feat. My Ignescence calls him, and he's quick to reply. Oh, doesn't he look good! It's always a joy to see him, so sparkly, gleaming and colorful! All the power of the most vivid light emanates from this Eidolon, an inner fire similar to mine. And let's not forget Gjallarhorn, with its multiple horns. I can't take my eyes off the guardian of the Bifrost and his instrument that plays four notes. I can't help but see them as fountains of color, or maybe cotton-candy machines. Waves of pink and blue energy pulse out, promising the birth of a rainbow. How can you not love that?\n\nI smile at him, encouraging him to blow harder. Our eyes meet. He understands what I want. His chest puffs out, then his cheeks. His eyebrows furrow. This is the moment we've been waiting for. The sound swells, transforming into an ever-stronger vibration. The waves emitted from Gjallarhorn are imbued with a range of saturated hues. They fill the whole area, getting into every corner. I can't resist the urge to bathe in the light by performing little dance steps at Heimdall's feet, brushing him with my hands. But he remains focused. He knows how to resist me. The sound grows stronger, and the rock explodes, collapsing the stone wall! Sunlight finally mingles with the colorful filaments of the rainbow. I remain there for a long time, enjoying this scene of hypnotic colors. What a shame Fen isn't here with me to appreciate this spectacle.\n\nSource\nHeimdall is the god of light and the moon in Norse mythology and has nine mothers. He is the guardian of Bifrost, the rainbow bridge that connects Asgard with Midgard. He wields Gjallarhorn and is tasked with sounding it to announce Ragnarok, the end of the world. In that final battle, he will have to kill the god Loki... and be killed by him."

It had been muted throughout my entire journey through the taiga, muffled by the dense boreal forest, suffocated by the mounds of snow. I wasn't used to being in places so devoid of sound. Of course, there had been the occasional creaking of a branch bending under the weight of the snow. But even then, the sound was dull and muffled, almost inaudible. To my ears, it was like a sea of white noise. So, hearing the Wnd whistle, whoosh and murmur again was a comfort. It was as if I'd been holding my breath for so long and then suddenly exhaled. Few realize how much the world is music. Each sound is a note within a symphony, and the Wind is responsible for carrying and broadcasting them all.\n\nI lean on the trunk of a birch tree to have a little rest. Then I close my eyes, allowing myself to be lulled by the world's sweet melody: the creaking of the ice, the hooting of an owl somewhere... I start to hum along, harmonizing my voice with the sounds of nature, and I suddenly feel my Ignescence firing up within me. I feel Aru's presence snuggling up against me, like she sometimes used to do during night vigils. Her Eidolon is here, I feel it, but I don't want to open my eyes in case it fades away. What might she be doing right now? Scolding Qannik maybe? Or taking care of Marang? Some Clan families had decided to stay behind, especially those looking after very young kids. They had been kindly allocated homes in Kladiver, but the separation still must have been hard. As it was between Aru and me..."

You could describe it as a sort of piercing cracking sound, and the first comparison I think of is the swooshing of a rope snapping and whipping through the air before the big top collapses. Except I'm not at the circus, but on an icy creek. Creek, ice, circus... well, they don't exactly rhyme, but they sound a bit similar. If Fen had been here, she would definitely have analyzed the musicality of the sound. But all I hear is a sinister omen. I immediately look down at the ice under my feet. Even though Nyala has passed by here, I don't think the ice is breaking up because of her skates. No, there are deep gashes that were made by something bigger and heavier.\n\nSkis or a sled perhaps? No, much bigger. A sleigh? I must say that the tracks have an elegant character, all chaotic interlacing and rampant traceries. But the stripes starting to radiate from them... Er, there's nothing refined or harmonious about those. They're all anger and black bile. I go to warn Nyala, who is still performing axels and toe loops without noticing that the lake is cracking. But suddenly, I hear children yelling and laughing near the bank. I turn towards them, feeling knots in my stomach. They don't seem to be aware of the danger around them. I try to make my mind up between the skater and the kids before rushing towards the little scamps and getting ready to throw random ideas of warmth over them to protect them from the cold. Glancing back, I see the ice give way under Nyala. I wanted to break the ice with her so we could patch things up. But this isn't what I had in mind."

His mane of white hair bobs from side to side as though he were reciting a nursery rhyme. That's Jack Frost, all right. He whistles as he contemplates Persephone's work all around us. I know he's pretending to ignore me. It's all part of the game. It's a lesson. I also look around the landscape, as if taking one last chance to absorb the spirits that bring this place to life with springtime joy, as if to imprint the colors and scents of the flowers and trees in my memory. I sigh.\n\nJack Frost giggles and jumps down to the ground. He taunts me, reminding me that he's here to fix my mistakes. I want to snap back at him, then remember he's a bit of a hothead… and he might really blow up at me. Well, more like blow ice and snow at me. Just as I did with Saskia, I look down at my feet and say nothing. It's time to give this biome its original wintry character back. Jack raises his staff and the colors instantly change – first from green to yellow, then to an autumnal ochre. The leaves begin to fall as a layer of frost forms on the ground. The Bickrosts, those little white horned rabbits that inhabit snowy forests, also suddenly emerge. Fascinated, they stare at the Eidolon as he continues his work. He does a little jig to entertain his furry audience, and the snow joins him in the dance. Everything is once again covered in white. Jack Frost gives a little bow. The lesson is over. I turn on my heel, stiffen my collar, and whisper goodbye to spring…"

My mind relaxes with each step through the snow, allowing my unconscious to reflect and explore a world of possibilities and potential solutions for the Spindle Tree. The muted crunch of my feet sinking into the snow is all I hear… until an expected sound nearby snaps me out of my musings. I turn to Spike, but no, the noise didn't come from him. I stand completely still and listen carefully. The source is nearby, and as I begin walking towards it, each step closer reveals a little more about it. A slight vibrato... wait, is that a snore? Who could be sleeping out here? Behind a tree trunk, I find a young Ordis recruit, stretched out on her back and sleeping like a baby. Not sure that a snowbank is the best place for a siesta…\n\nAs I reach out to her shoulder to shake her awake, I notice something on her chest, gazing thoughtfully at her sleeping face. It's a mush. Well, a Snoozer Shroom to be precise. I quickly notice that a bit of its cap has been nibbled away. Well, I guess that explains the soldier's untimely nap. Another novice who didn't pay attention during their training about the dangers of the forest. Still, the mush's red cap with blue scales should have been an obvious warning. I borrow the recruit's waterproof gloves and pick up the little mushroom, which then offers me a bit of its cap. No thanks, little one, I just ate. And I know all about your narcotic properties. But I'll save it for later so I can make a soup that brings on a deep, refreshing sleep, like certain moms do for their overactive kids. In the meantime, I'll need to brew some herbal tea for the recruit, who'll likely wake up with a nasty cold… What was she doing out here all alone, anyway?"

The trees, the bushes… everything is covered with ice, giving the whole place a bluish hue and lending the tune I'm now hearing a crystalline quality. It's a soft and somber melody, hummed slowly, and it immediately draws me in. Who could be the source of this lament? I follow a vague path that winds among the tree trunks. A feeling of loneliness moves me to my core. Though it's a sad song, its mood is one of melancholy, not despair. And suddenly, the tone shifts – it becomes more cheerful, with a quicker tempo. With a whoosh, a rabbit made of ice dashes between my legs. I look around wide-eyed, trying to figure out where it came from – which turns out to be from the same direction as the singing, apparently. I quicken my pace. And whoosh, I'm nearly run over by an ice fawn charging by at full speed. All at once, I see her: a beautiful young woman with pale skin and a snowflake-shaped crown on her head.\n\nShe turns in place, humming her tune as she sculpts the ice coming out of her fingertips into a streamlined body, four delicate little paws, a slender snout, and finally a long bushy tail. It's an ice fox taking shape in her hands. It comes to life and runs a few circles around her. There's something strange here: The farther we push on into the frozen expanse of Storhvit, the more Eidolons we find manifesting without being summoned. It's not unheard of to see one spontaneously appear in Asgartha, but it's certainly rare. I should ask Akesha about this – surely she'd know why they appear to us here even if we don't know them or have any memory of them. The young woman keeps making one animal sculpture after another, as though trying to repopulate the whole place with icy life. Her creations frolic around her. And the feeling of loneliness that had haunted me now gradually fades away."

The snow maiden then comes to life, growing up quickly while maintaining a very pale complexion. When spring arrives, she becomes listless and lethargic. To cheer her up, her friends invite her to dance with them around a bonfire and take turns jumping over it. But when she jumps, Snegurochka turns into a snowy mist and disappears."

I cast a glance at Sunisa and see that her shield already has several scratches. My aide-de-camp is covering our left and using the tip of her spear to try and repel the Tumult creatures attacking us. There are so many of them... seemingly an endless number. But we need to stay strong to allow the convoy to get through the pass. A clawed paw strikes my shield, lacerating the surface. I feel the weight of the attack on my shoulder, but grit my teeth and manage to withstand the impact. I push the creature away, using all my strength to force it to retreat. Wingspan manages to grab it with his beak and flicks it even further away.\n\nThe beasts swarming around us hiss, watching and waiting for an opportunity. I need to use this brief moment of calm to turn this clash to our advantage. Wingspan spreads his wings and takes off, his heavy wings generating powerful gusts. The creatures jump back. Now. I plant my sword in the ground, drawing on the Mana of my Alter Ego. With my free hand, I draw a Glyph in the air before placing it on the ground. The Eidolon of Maibritt appears in front of me, raising her thick shield to provide cover for me. And she's not alone. Another Ordis recruit appears at her sides. Halberds and lances glint within the ranks of the Tumult creatures. By concentrating my Mana, I call forth a torrent of paper sheets from my imagination. They fill the air and flutter around like a blizzard. Wherever a sheet lands, it sticks as if covered in glue. I smile as I see the creatures trapped under a pile of sticky sheets of paper."

I suddenly receive a lecture from Gulrang, telling me to be quiet. Is now not the right time for poetry? Just because a formidable enemy stands before us, should we suppress our artistic ambitions? So be it!\n\nStanding upright on my stone pedestal, I blow a long blast into my horn, signaling to the lancers to move. Gul is among them, her heavy pavise raised to cover their advance. She looks at me and gives me a subtle nod. I blast out another note with my instrument, calling all soldiers to get into position. In unison, Lyra percussionists and fife-players begin to play in rhythm, but the performance rapidly descends into a cacophony with all the movement of the troops. Ha! They need a conductor to keep time. I warn Gulrang, and I sense the ideas she channels in return pass through my whole body to flow out into the world. Glyphs meaning \"Coordination\", \"Arrangement\" and \"Harmonization\" appear on my conch one by one. And I blow with all my strength into the horn, with my internal mechanisms acting as bellows, to spread the words to all the troubadours…"

I'm just about to make a wisecrack when I remember that it's no longer Sunisa accompanying me but a completely new recruit. Sun is miles away, preparing to ascend the eastern flank of the Cais Adarra as per my orders. Nina's temperament is the exact opposite of my previous aide-de-camp's. Sunisa is cheeky and never at a loss for words, whereas Nina is much more discreet, even deferential, and it's a radical change for me. I've got nothing against her, but I have to admit that I miss Sun and her sharp tongue. But maybe it's just a matter of time until Nina feels comfortable enough to express her personality…\n\nAround us, the tree trunks are covered in mushrooms with red and blue caps, and spores drift through the air like snowflakes. It's actually pretty nice to be out of the dense thickets of conifers and in a much brighter and more spacious part of the woods. I hear a suspicious rustling a little way off, and I raise my fist. Nina stops immediately, her lance at the ready. Using our battle code, I instruct her to take up position on my flank and stay back as I slowly advance towards the source of the noise. If we run into Belisenki here, things could quickly turn ugly. I look at the tops of the trees, then the snow-covered embankments… It doesn't take long to identify the cause of the sound because it's making no effort to hide. It's a little snowman no higher than my knee, carrying a full set of camping gear on its back. A Chimaera? I decide to follow it…"

The web-footed creature zigzags through the trees, hopping and occasionally sliding on its belly to pick up speed down the snowy slopes. In its bag, it's carrying all kinds of little trinkets stolen from the camp, including the ring Hasret gave back to me. That ring carries far too many bittersweet memories: from the day she accepted it from me, trying to hide her emotions behind a wall of sarcasm and indifference, to the night she returned it, knowing that our days together before my departure were coming to an end… There's no way I'm letting some damn bird steal it from me. Using Heka, I stamp a Glyph onto the trunk of an old birch and a pack of bloodhounds leaps out, yapping and barking excitedly.\n\nLet the hunt begin! The dogs immediately begin sniffing out the tracks, then quickly set off in pursuit. That thieving bird might have been able to shake me off its trail, but it won't escape my dogs. Fen was right to ask for my help. She had assigned me to find its nest, filled with its illicit spoils. And now my hounds are catching up to the plunderer. In a panic, it drops a few items, which plop softly into the snow. But no matter how fast it runs, it will end up cornered. I suddenly hear squealing and oinking. I stop running and look over to see the Three Little Pigs scampering towards me. They look like they're being chased by some indescribable danger. I curse to myself, knowing full well that I can't just leave without helping them. I whistle to my dogs to send them towards the camp. Then I yell at the Eidolons – whoever may have summoned them – to follow my pups right away."

The web-footed creature zigzags through the trees, hopping and occasionally sliding on its belly to pick up speed down the snowy slopes. In its bag, it's carrying all kinds of little trinkets stolen from the camp, including the ring Hasret gave back to me. That ring carries far too many bittersweet memories: from the day she accepted it from me, trying to hide her emotions behind a wall of sarcasm and indifference, to the night she returned it, knowing that our days together before my departure were coming to an end… There's no way I'm letting some damn bird steal it from me. Using Heka, I stamp a Glyph onto the trunk of an old birch and a pack of bloodhounds leaps out, yapping and barking excitedly.\n\nLet the hunt begin! The dogs immediately begin sniffing out the tracks, then quickly set off in pursuit. That thieving bird might have been able to shake me off its trail, but it won't escape my dogs. Fen was right to ask for my help. She had assigned me to find its nest, filled with its illicit spoils. And now my hounds are catching up to the plunderer. In a panic, it drops a few items, which plop softly into the snow. But no matter how fast it runs, it will end up cornered. I suddenly hear squealing and oinking. I stop running and look over to see the Three Little Pigs scampering towards me. They look like they're being chased by some indescribable danger. I curse to myself, knowing full well that I can't just leave without helping them. I whistle to my dogs to send them towards the camp. Then I yell at the Eidolons – whoever may have summoned them – to follow my pups right away."

These huge, ochre-colored rock formations are half-mineral and half-organic according to the Muna. But I didn't follow the scientific explanations too closely, I'll admit. I take my place in the ranks of officers charged with leading the exploration operations. I'm facing the non-commissioned officer who's come to explain the overall strategic picture for the coming weeks. Although she seems clearly out of her element, she's lost nothing of her natural authority. Despite the intense cold here and the wind blowing into the valley from the tundra, she's still wearing the standard uniform. She must be freezing, but she hasn't shown the slightest sign of discomfort or weakness. Standing straight as a rod, she unfurls the scrolls of official orders and comments on them in a strong, steady voice. She reminds us of the bureaucratic guidelines and fundamental laws that we all know by heart.\n\nThe ranks of NCOs and field officers are much calmer and more focused than their usual distracted selves, captivated by the commander's impressive poise. Behind her, aides do their best to keep documents, maps and plans from being blown away in a sudden gust of wind. Their efforts are in vain, but the papers swirling around the supervisor don't disturb her briefing in the least. She announces that reinforcements will be sent ahead to deal with a critical situation further out in the zone. She mentions alarming reports about our scouts being harassed by Belisenki. I listen carefully because the next part affects us directly. Obviously, we'll be the ones assigned to join up with the advance guard and hold the line until reinforcements arrive. She finally stops speaking and looks us straight in the eye. A heavy silence settles over the ranks. My comrades and I all sense the gravity of this moment. Once she feels that the message has sunk in, her jaw relaxes a little. Any questions?"

These huge, ochre-colored rock formations are half-mineral and half-organic according to the Muna. But I didn't follow the scientific explanations too closely, I'll admit. I take my place in the ranks of officers charged with leading the exploration operations. I'm facing the non-commissioned officer who's come to explain the overall strategic picture for the coming weeks. Although she seems clearly out of her element, she's lost nothing of her natural authority. Despite the intense cold here and the wind blowing into the valley from the tundra, she's still wearing the standard uniform. She must be freezing, but she hasn't shown the slightest sign of discomfort or weakness. Standing straight as a rod, she unfurls the scrolls of official orders and comments on them in a strong, steady voice. She reminds us of the bureaucratic guidelines and fundamental laws that we all know by heart.\n\nThe ranks of NCOs and field officers are much calmer and more focused than their usual distracted selves, captivated by the commander's impressive poise. Behind her, aides do their best to keep documents, maps and plans from being blown away in a sudden gust of wind. Their efforts are in vain, but the papers swirling around the supervisor don't disturb her briefing in the least. She announces that reinforcements will be sent ahead to deal with a critical situation further out in the zone. She mentions alarming reports about our scouts being harassed by Belisenki. I listen carefully because the next part affects us directly. Obviously, we'll be the ones assigned to join up with the advance guard and hold the line until reinforcements arrive. She finally stops speaking and looks us straight in the eye. A heavy silence settles over the ranks. My comrades and I all sense the gravity of this moment. Once she feels that the message has sunk in, her jaw relaxes a little. Any questions?"

We're running breathlessly to reach the edge of the forest with the Belisenki right on our heels, and it's absolutely exhausting. Running isn't my strong suit, especially in the snow, and I doubt our pursuers would be interested in hearing me hold forth on the benefits of diplomatic discussions. I can't keep this up much longer. And the rest of my companions, who are scattering in all directions in a highly questionable display of military discipline, don't seem ready to spearhead any sort of counterattack. We need to stop our attackers and put an end to this rout. We need to do something to turn things around. For a public official like myself, inspiring fear and awe among the enemy is supposed to be one of my most powerful tools. If only I'd been a better student of military debacles and strategic retreats, perhaps I could get us out of this mess!\n\nUp ahead, the blizzard intensifies. That certainly won't help our cause. Unless… The Heka lights up my hands as I trace the necessary symbols in the wind. Carried by the swirling gusts, a gigantic paper scroll unfurls in a circle before us. At its center, Dong Da Shen lounges on a lump of snow, a magnificent blue cape whipping in the wind at his back. I hope that his presence will bring fear to our enemies while easing our own. Ideograms written on the scroll blaze with an azure flame. I remember that the document Dong Da Shen holds is a statement of criminal charges. His inquisitorial voice thunders as he points his scepter at the wintry mob. He's the perfect choice here as he is the god of cold, and his painted mask is the face of winter. Yielding to his authority, the Belisenki disperse and return to the shelter of the trees. I'll be feeling all manner of aches, pains and sore joints before long, but considering the alternative, that's really not so bad."

We're running breathlessly to reach the edge of the forest with the Belisenki right on our heels, and it's absolutely exhausting. Running isn't my strong suit, especially in the snow, and I doubt our pursuers would be interested in hearing me hold forth on the benefits of diplomatic discussions. I can't keep this up much longer. And the rest of my companions, who are scattering in all directions in a highly questionable display of military discipline, don't seem ready to spearhead any sort of counterattack. We need to stop our attackers and put an end to this rout. We need to do something to turn things around. For a public official like myself, inspiring fear and awe among the enemy is supposed to be one of my most powerful tools. If only I'd been a better student of military debacles and strategic retreats, perhaps I could get us out of this mess!\n\nUp ahead, the blizzard intensifies. That certainly won't help our cause. Unless… The Heka lights up my hands as I trace the necessary symbols in the wind. Carried by the swirling gusts, a gigantic paper scroll unfurls in a circle before us. At its center, Dong Da Shen lounges on a lump of snow, a magnificent blue cape whipping in the wind at his back. I hope that his presence will bring fear to our enemies while easing our own. Ideograms written on the scroll blaze with an azure flame. I remember that the document Dong Da Shen holds is a statement of criminal charges. His inquisitorial voice thunders as he points his scepter at the wintry mob. He's the perfect choice here as he is the god of cold, and his painted mask is the face of winter. Yielding to his authority, the Belisenki disperse and return to the shelter of the trees. I'll be feeling all manner of aches, pains and sore joints before long, but considering the alternative, that's really not so bad."

Her quarters are cramped, overflowing with papers and books, and always filled with bureaucratic clutter. Sitting at her desk, which is stacked high with documents, and bundled up in a warm but quite impractical outfit, she inventories, indexes, counts, reimburses and orders everything we'll need for our expedition to succeed in the days to come. As well as managing our supplies while we sleep soundly, she continues to work behind the scenes to protect us: changing the patrol schedules, optimizing the sentinel rotations, ensuring that the fires are maintained… in short, all the small but essential details that are completely invisible to the rest of the team.\n\nI lift the flap at the entrance to her tent, and the candle flame flickers in the sudden breeze. And, as usual, I find her hard at work. I bid her good evening, and she replies instinctively with an attempt at a smile, although I know she's completely focused on her tasks. Then she returns to her work, picking up papers and scribbling notes. I wait for her to finish so that I can ask her about my current topic of study. I've recently been hearing persistent rumors about the fortuitous appearance of previously unknown Eidolons. As someone far more accustomed to building my arsenal of invocations through reading than direct observation, I'm intrigued by this phenomenon. Could it be that the mere fact of confronting this harsh winter is reawakening memories in us, perhaps somehow linked to our collective unconscious? Is there some deep legacy buried in our shared psyche? I'd been eager to have this discussion with the nightwarden. She finally sets down her reed pen and turns to me, offering me a welcome cup of tea on this chilly night."

Her quarters are cramped, overflowing with papers and books, and always filled with bureaucratic clutter. Sitting at her desk, which is stacked high with documents, and bundled up in a warm but quite impractical outfit, she inventories, indexes, counts, reimburses and orders everything we'll need for our expedition to succeed in the days to come. As well as managing our supplies while we sleep soundly, she continues to work behind the scenes to protect us: changing the patrol schedules, optimizing the sentinel rotations, ensuring that the fires are maintained… in short, all the small but essential details that are completely invisible to the rest of the team.\n\nI lift the flap at the entrance to her tent, and the candle flame flickers in the sudden breeze. And, as usual, I find her hard at work. I bid her good evening, and she replies instinctively with an attempt at a smile, although I know she's completely focused on her tasks. Then she returns to her work, picking up papers and scribbling notes. I wait for her to finish so that I can ask her about my current topic of study. I've recently been hearing persistent rumors about the fortuitous appearance of previously unknown Eidolons. As someone far more accustomed to building my arsenal of invocations through reading than direct observation, I'm intrigued by this phenomenon. Could it be that the mere fact of confronting this harsh winter is reawakening memories in us, perhaps somehow linked to our collective unconscious? Is there some deep legacy buried in our shared psyche? I'd been eager to have this discussion with the nightwarden. She finally sets down her reed pen and turns to me, offering me a welcome cup of tea on this chilly night."

How did it come to this? The whole team lacks organization, not to mention any sense of solidarity. Is there no one to manage our resources fairly? I have half a mind to lecture them on the virtues of collective management, our shared responsibility for each other's well-being, the importance of planning ahead… but I haven't the strength. Besides, my speech would surely be interrupted by the rumbling of empty stomachs. It's better to save my strength for later, when it's time to take stock. I close the lid with an exasperated sigh and sit down on the crate. Just because I'm not voicing my complaints doesn't mean I should sit around idly. With the tip of my cane, I draw Glyphs in the snow, infusing them with the bare minimum of Mana.\n\nA small gentleman appears, as dry and wrinkled as a vine in winter and as shriveled as a piece of overcooked meat. He wears an ancient, battered top hat, which sits over a severe face framed by a bushy beard. He's wrapped in a moth-eaten, threadbare old overcoat that should have been retired years ago. He barks at me in a hoarse, creaking voice, then gives the crate I'm sitting on a tentative kick – and immediately understands from its hollow echo how much trouble we're in. For an emergency this bad, I need equally strong support. Ebenezer is an inflexible old quartermaster who will efficiently administer and ration our remaining supplies. He's got the keen eye of a buzzard when it comes to optimizing, planning and determining rations so we can all get through this together. But until he's ready to loosen the purse strings, we're going to have to tighten our belts…"

How did it come to this? The whole team lacks organization, not to mention any sense of solidarity. Is there no one to manage our resources fairly? I have half a mind to lecture them on the virtues of collective management, our shared responsibility for each other's well-being, the importance of planning ahead… but I haven't the strength. Besides, my speech would surely be interrupted by the rumbling of empty stomachs. It's better to save my strength for later, when it's time to take stock. I close the lid with an exasperated sigh and sit down on the crate. Just because I'm not voicing my complaints doesn't mean I should sit around idly. With the tip of my cane, I draw Glyphs in the snow, infusing them with the bare minimum of Mana.\n\nA small gentleman appears, as dry and wrinkled as a vine in winter and as shriveled as a piece of overcooked meat. He wears an ancient, battered top hat, which sits over a severe face framed by a bushy beard. He's wrapped in a moth-eaten, threadbare old overcoat that should have been retired years ago. He barks at me in a hoarse, creaking voice, then gives the crate I'm sitting on a tentative kick – and immediately understands from its hollow echo how much trouble we're in. For an emergency this bad, I need equally strong support. Ebenezer is an inflexible old quartermaster who will efficiently administer and ration our remaining supplies. He's got the keen eye of a buzzard when it comes to optimizing, planning and determining rations so we can all get through this together. But until he's ready to loosen the purse strings, we're going to have to tighten our belts…"

With my shield held out in front to protect me from the glacial wind, I make my way up the slope at a grindingly slow pace as my boots sink deep into the powder. And this blizzard… It keeps blowing and swirling and gaining in intensity, and the higher we climb, the more the stinging snow lashes at our faces. It feels like our cheeks are being scrubbed with sandpaper. For a brief moment, I can't help cursing Sigismar, who stayed behind to accompany the last group of explorers and cover their rear flank. I know he wanted to help by giving me more responsibilities, but at this point I've had it up to here with his so-called responsibilities. And I hate – and I mean absolutely hate – getting my feet wet.\n\nEven so, I'm not about to quit. We'll make it up Cais Adarra, and all we need to get there is willpower – sheer, uncompromising, military-grade willpower. Sig always used to jokingly ask what I was doing there when I could have easily applied to join the Bravos, where my surly attitude would have been a better fit. He obviously had no idea what he was talking about. What mattered most to me was the shared effort: dedicating my energy to others, not to myself. And on some level, he knew that. But that wasn't about to stop me from saying what I had to say or from complaining when something wasn't right. I know I owe my position entirely to my superior officer's whims. Anyone else looking at my file would have thrown my application out without a second thought considering my notorious record of insolence. The worst part is, I still don't know why Sig chose me as his warrant officer. All I know is that I'm not going to waste the chance he's given me."

With my shield held out in front to protect me from the glacial wind, I make my way up the slope at a grindingly slow pace as my boots sink deep into the powder. And this blizzard… It keeps blowing and swirling and gaining in intensity, and the higher we climb, the more the stinging snow lashes at our faces. It feels like our cheeks are being scrubbed with sandpaper. For a brief moment, I can't help cursing Sigismar, who stayed behind to accompany the last group of explorers and cover their rear flank. I know he wanted to help by giving me more responsibilities, but at this point I've had it up to here with his so-called responsibilities. And I hate – and I mean absolutely hate – getting my feet wet.\n\nEven so, I'm not about to quit. We'll make it up Cais Adarra, and all we need to get there is willpower – sheer, uncompromising, military-grade willpower. Sig always used to jokingly ask what I was doing there when I could have easily applied to join the Bravos, where my surly attitude would have been a better fit. He obviously had no idea what he was talking about. What mattered most to me was the shared effort: dedicating my energy to others, not to myself. And on some level, he knew that. But that wasn't about to stop me from saying what I had to say or from complaining when something wasn't right. I know I owe my position entirely to my superior officer's whims. Anyone else looking at my file would have thrown my application out without a second thought considering my notorious record of insolence. The worst part is, I still don't know why Sig chose me as his warrant officer. All I know is that I'm not going to waste the chance he's given me."

Talking with this Lyra storyteller is a real pleasure as he seems to have a thousand stories in his pack… as well as thousands more historic and fictional anecdotes. Of course, there's no proof to support the truth of his tales, but it's a joy to immerse myself in the legends he's learned by heart and that he can share around the fire – or while walking through the bowels of a vast glacier, like we're doing now. I had never crossed paths with him in the Ouroboros, but this chance encounter with his expedition had been a stroke of luck and a genuine blessing. Suddenly, however, something catches my attention, and I place my hand on my companion's arm to ask him to be quiet for a moment. There's a tenuous sound, seemingly from far away.\n\nI hear a dull pounding, followed by breathless shouts. The storyteller listens too and furrows his brow. The cries seem to be coming from behind a thick barrier of ice, which is blocking our path to the source of this apparent call for help. I quickly consider our options and decide to call on the Bear King Valemon, who should be more than strong enough to break open this icy cell. I place my Glyphs on the walls, and the old white bear materializes within the translucent veil with his front paws extended. By sheer force of will, he twists and deforms the ice. I step back and take cover, of course. The ice sublimates in a sudden cloud of steam, opening a narrow passage to the other side. Let's hurry – someone needs our help."

Talking with this Lyra storyteller is a real pleasure as he seems to have a thousand stories in his pack… as well as thousands more historic and fictional anecdotes. Of course, there's no proof to support the truth of his tales, but it's a joy to immerse myself in the legends he's learned by heart and that he can share around the fire – or while walking through the bowels of a vast glacier, like we're doing now. I had never crossed paths with him in the Ouroboros, but this chance encounter with his expedition had been a stroke of luck and a genuine blessing. Suddenly, however, something catches my attention, and I place my hand on my companion's arm to ask him to be quiet for a moment. There's a tenuous sound, seemingly from far away.\n\nI hear a dull pounding, followed by breathless shouts. The storyteller listens too and furrows his brow. The cries seem to be coming from behind a thick barrier of ice, which is blocking our path to the source of this apparent call for help. I quickly consider our options and decide to call on the Bear King Valemon, who should be more than strong enough to break open this icy cell. I place my Glyphs on the walls, and the old white bear materializes within the translucent veil with his front paws extended. By sheer force of will, he twists and deforms the ice. I step back and take cover, of course. The ice sublimates in a sudden cloud of steam, opening a narrow passage to the other side. Let's hurry – someone needs our help."

Though they're distorted by the thick ice, I can still make out the shapes of an Yzmir warlock and another explorer, trapped on the other side along the shore of a large subterranean lake. I tap on the wall of ice and see the warlock make his way towards me. Mack observes the scene through my eyes and warns me that the man no longer has enough Mana to do anything more than protect himself from the cold. I test the ice between us with my hands. It's as though it appeared instantly, leaving these poor adventurers no time to escape. And the same phenomenon is now quickly consuming all of their warmth, covering their clothes with ice and frost at an alarming rate.\n\nTime is of the essence here. They're both showing signs of acute hypothermia. While the warlock is still managing to stay on his feet, the same can't be said for his companion, who is lying on the ground, his vital signs rapidly weakening. We need to get them out of there now. I signal to the Lyra storyteller, who unwinds a rope to pull out the prisoners once I break the translucent bars of their icy jail. I trace a rough Glyph on the wall. It bears the raw, unsubtle idea of an explosion, and I hope it'll be enough to break through the wall. I can already see new patterns of frost forming on the surface, a sign that the freezing process is still ongoing and that the mass of ice will only grow thicker with time. The warlock shivers, but his eyes are full of hope. I infuse the Glyph with Mana as the storyteller twirls his grappling hook…"

Though they're distorted by the thick ice, I can still make out the shapes of an Yzmir warlock and another explorer, trapped on the other side along the shore of a large subterranean lake. I tap on the wall of ice and see the warlock make his way towards me. Mack observes the scene through my eyes and warns me that the man no longer has enough Mana to do anything more than protect himself from the cold. I test the ice between us with my hands. It's as though it appeared instantly, leaving these poor adventurers no time to escape. And the same phenomenon is now quickly consuming all of their warmth, covering their clothes with ice and frost at an alarming rate.\n\nTime is of the essence here. They're both showing signs of acute hypothermia. While the warlock is still managing to stay on his feet, the same can't be said for his companion, who is lying on the ground, his vital signs rapidly weakening. We need to get them out of there now. I signal to the Lyra storyteller, who unwinds a rope to pull out the prisoners once I break the translucent bars of their icy jail. I trace a rough Glyph on the wall. It bears the raw, unsubtle idea of an explosion, and I hope it'll be enough to break through the wall. I can already see new patterns of frost forming on the surface, a sign that the freezing process is still ongoing and that the mass of ice will only grow thicker with time. The warlock shivers, but his eyes are full of hope. I infuse the Glyph with Mana as the storyteller twirls his grappling hook…"

Outside, the colors are fading from the sky, and while it's still light for now, night will be falling before long. Clerks and couriers bow as I pass, and I return their greetings, though I don't have much time for niceties. I head for the main dais in the back office and approach the liaison officer. The young woman runs her fingertips over the letters, deciphering the Braille letters that she receives before passing them on to the relevant people or departments. I cough slightly to announce my presence, and she stops reading. I enter my personal Glyph in her registry, and she checks it with her fingertips before handing me two Paper Heralds. One is from the Admiralty, and the other… The other is from my sister back in Arkaster.\n\nI first unseal the snake-shaped origami and deftly unfold it to reveal Admiral Singh's initials. As my eyes scan the message, I feel a knot forming in my stomach. The Ouroboros has detected Tumult waves coming in our direction, and they will hit our location in a few days. I immediately set off for General Sekifu's offices. It's a race against time. The general staff must be informed right away of the evacuation order. The orders instruct us to immediately head to the Cais Adarra and take shelter within the Oasis. My steps echo on the floors of the temporary citadel, and there at the entrance is Sunisa, who seems to instinctively sense my concern. And for once, she refrains from any clever comments. I notice that I'm still holding my sister's letter in my hand. I'm afraid this missive will have to wait."

Outside, the colors are fading from the sky, and while it's still light for now, night will be falling before long. Clerks and couriers bow as I pass, and I return their greetings, though I don't have much time for niceties. I head for the main dais in the back office and approach the liaison officer. The young woman runs her fingertips over the letters, deciphering the Braille letters that she receives before passing them on to the relevant people or departments. I cough slightly to announce my presence, and she stops reading. I enter my personal Glyph in her registry, and she checks it with her fingertips before handing me two Paper Heralds. One is from the Admiralty, and the other… The other is from my sister back in Arkaster.\n\nI first unseal the snake-shaped origami and deftly unfold it to reveal Admiral Singh's initials. As my eyes scan the message, I feel a knot forming in my stomach. The Ouroboros has detected Tumult waves coming in our direction, and they will hit our location in a few days. I immediately set off for General Sekifu's offices. It's a race against time. The general staff must be informed right away of the evacuation order. The orders instruct us to immediately head to the Cais Adarra and take shelter within the Oasis. My steps echo on the floors of the temporary citadel, and there at the entrance is Sunisa, who seems to instinctively sense my concern. And for once, she refrains from any clever comments. I notice that I'm still holding my sister's letter in my hand. I'm afraid this missive will have to wait."

It melts the snow, determined to wage war on winter all by itself and visibly annoyed by the cold constantly assailing its territory. I feel my men's eyes on my back and sense a bit of challenge in their attitude. I raise an eyebrow. All right, I'll show them what I'm made of. But I'm not going to launch a frontal assault on this walking hibachi – I don't want to ruin my uniform. I cross my arms and look as indifferent as possible, then turn to my troopers, more in jest than in actual defiance. I signal to my new aide-de-camp to bring me my things, and she promptly obeys. Then, like a matador entering the ring, I take a few steps towards the creature.\n\nI write my Glyphs on a piece of paper and calmly charge it with Mana, like an assassin sharpening his blades. Whispers and murmurs sweep through the ranks as bets are placed. Here comes the fun part. I toss the paper onto the ground with a disdainful gesture, like throwing down a gauntlet. There are chuckles and jeers behind me… I turn towards them, flash them an ironic smile, then whip around to shout at the angry Jinn. Naturally, the Eidolon instantly leaps towards me, like an enraged bull rushing at a red cape… and promptly falls into the trap, just as I expected. In a sudden swirl of paper, a cage forms around the flaming Jinn. Behind me comes the sound of cheers, applause and a few disappointed exclamations. Florets are handed from losers to winners as I wave to the crowd. I can't wait to see my score."

It melts the snow, determined to wage war on winter all by itself and visibly annoyed by the cold constantly assailing its territory. I feel my men's eyes on my back and sense a bit of challenge in their attitude. I raise an eyebrow. All right, I'll show them what I'm made of. But I'm not going to launch a frontal assault on this walking hibachi – I don't want to ruin my uniform. I cross my arms and look as indifferent as possible, then turn to my troopers, more in jest than in actual defiance. I signal to my new aide-de-camp to bring me my things, and she promptly obeys. Then, like a matador entering the ring, I take a few steps towards the creature.\n\nI write my Glyphs on a piece of paper and calmly charge it with Mana, like an assassin sharpening his blades. Whispers and murmurs sweep through the ranks as bets are placed. Here comes the fun part. I toss the paper onto the ground with a disdainful gesture, like throwing down a gauntlet. There are chuckles and jeers behind me… I turn towards them, flash them an ironic smile, then whip around to shout at the angry Jinn. Naturally, the Eidolon instantly leaps towards me, like an enraged bull rushing at a red cape… and promptly falls into the trap, just as I expected. In a sudden swirl of paper, a cage forms around the flaming Jinn. Behind me comes the sound of cheers, applause and a few disappointed exclamations. Florets are handed from losers to winners as I wave to the crowd. I can't wait to see my score."

I need to fill the hole that's just appeared in our ranks. I leap in and seal the breach as the creatures' assault batters my aegis. My shoulder is killing me, but I grit my teeth and yell to my companions to hold strong, even though I doubt they can hear me. The battle has turned into an ocean of blades and wings, with our initially tight ranks gradually growing ever sparser. At this rate, we won't hold out for long. I look up and see an enemy swarm attempting a new incursion from above. Bravos and Muna archers unleash a volley of arrows to drive them off, but with each strike, the Belisenki get closer and closer to their objective.

We are alone in the wooded expanse of the taiga, and there's no harm in letting her take control of her own existence for a few minutes, or even a few hours, if I'm in a permissive mood. Her shoulders sag as I let her retake some measure of control over her body. Tears run down her cheeks as I settle into the background. But her spirits remain strong. She stumbles, then starts touching the snow. She knows she doesn't have much time, so she'll have to make the most of it. She looks left, then right. The Arcolano Milk flowing through her veins gives her a view of an immaculate land. She touches the trunk of a birch tree and breathes in its scent, savoring this brief moment of freedom.\n\nThen she sees a small, nearly transparent chrysalis on a branch. Ah, a Mana moth. I feel a knot form in her stomach as she realizes she's not so different. She, too, is waiting to emerge from her cocoon, from her prison. But I remind her with a thought that as long as I'm her jailer, it is I who decides when she can leave and when she must remain in her cell. Defiant, she concentrates her Mana and breathes it into the nymph. Perhaps it's an act of rebellion for her, to use the Mana I've gathered on such an insignificant action. But I allow her to do it. Almost immediately, the chrysalis splits open, and a moth emerges from it with a series of pushes. Is this really how she wants to spend her free time? Ah, but now I understand. This creature can truly be free, unlike her. So she watches, intoxicated, living vicariously through the emerging moth. She knows perfectly well that I will never release my grip on her…"

Some of them shiver, trying to regulate their body heat, while others do their best to acclimate to the cold. The Queen moves between the rows of students as lacy wisps of ice form around her and on everything she touches or brushes against. Their breath slows, as do their minds as they seek to let go of any parasitic thoughts. The goal is to reach a state of stasis where all that remains is the idea, the mental puzzle that we must solve. With my consent, Lindiwe's psyche becomes a mirror with multiple sides, and time seems to slow down. It's as if we now have all eternity to contemplate the matter before our eyes. How to capture the idea of the Empyrean, while limiting Remanence? For Lindiwe, the answer would be a prism, so I allow her to fashion one.\n\nBy playing with the fractals and reflections, Lindiwe can make certain images disappear, keeping only the aspects that she wishes to focus on. Through her, I refine the idea she has enclosed within her, sharpening it until it reaches the keen edge I desire. Without this step, its ethereal force would be far too raw and primordial to be fully controlled. I feel the Snow Queen exploring my host's mind, observing the puzzle she has built in her psyche to restrain the idea that I've hooked through the Veil for her. Like a fisher too timid with her line, she used small bait and a net to avoid getting her hands dirty. When, of course, she could just as easily have plunged her bare hands into the torrent to seize her prey… But I mustn't betray my presence. I must make Lindiwe's mind a sufficiently complex puzzle that I can hide in its cracks and corners without being detected."

It's as if they are there without really being there, diffusing Mana into the air like a censer spreading its incense. Have any of the Muna figured out these moths' role in the ecosystem? Could they be involved in dispersing substance into the world, to strengthen the Oasis? All I can say from my perspective is that their dance is an enchanting, almost hypnotic spectacle. But there's one thing I've noticed: The presence of Mana moths often means that Belisenki are nearby. They appear like portents, as though warning us to make a detour or even turn back right away. I've even seen intrepid Bravos explorers hesitate to move forward after coming across a clearing full of moths. But they don't scare me one bit.\n\nMaybe common sense should tell me to fear them more, but I can't help being fascinated by their ephemeral existence, the incredibly short lives that they live without complaint. It must be because, for me, they symbolize something more than advance warning of an attack. I've observed them at length during each of my visits to Saskia's little shack. For me, their presence recalls the scent of chamomile, the warmth of a fire crackling in the hearth, and the silhouette of the Muna studying these little creatures just a few feet away from me. Just at the sight of them, I'm irresistibly drawn back to those memories like a magnet. I slowly raise my hand and let a drop of Mana form in my palm. A moth lands alongside it and unfurls its proboscis to sip at the liquid. Drink, little one. This nectar will add a few precious minutes to your life."

There's no denying the facts: Breaking the spelunker's lamp in the midst of exploring a cave was not the best option. We've been groping our way along for some time now, and the rocky outcrops are becoming more and more dangerous, asymmetrical, jagged and sharp. The members of the expedition have cuts and bruises all over their hands and knees. It's impossible to clearly see what kinds of traps await us in this hole. I suggest to Lindiwe that she come up with an enlightening solution. She stops, reflects and searches through her pockets for an object: a bulb of translucent leaded glass with a small chain at one end. It's a perfectly ordinary item with multiple uses: a container for samples, a vial to be opened or smashed on the ground in an emergency… But at the moment, it is empty. The Alterer unscrews its metal top and slips in her Aether shard, as I instruct her.\n\nShe blows softly into the bulb, producing a shimmering mist, then replaces the cover with a quick twist of her hand. The Mana inside the tube makes the jewel rattle. And all of a sudden, a swarm of luminous moths appear, swirling around the bulb, which turns into a makeshift lamp through the mere presence of these fluttering, glowing creatures. Light is finally restored to the cave, revealing the nature of the path ahead. The sight before us is truly magical to behold, and I grant Lindiwe the pleasure of sensing it. The rocky outcrops are in fact magnificent and impressive crystals, and their acute angles cast bright rays onto every surface in the cavern. The moths are flying around the bulb; now it's time to keep them there. Lindiwe concentrates, places her hands on the lantern glass, and with an abrupt movement driven by a fresh spike of Mana, imparts a twist to the bulb, which draws in and captures the moths. The Alterer smiles, mirroring my own satisfaction."

He plays with her and ensures she doesn't get into any more trouble. And I don't think the little girl minds. But we'll need to find her little caravan if she's to return to her family. Well, we don't have any choice. I take my Construct out of its case and start to rearrange the buttons. A little puffin appears in front of me, flapping its wings and looking both adorable and helpless. But it has Icarus's jet pack on its back, and I intend to send it far above the clouds so it can tell us what it sees – and more importantly, where to go. It starts hopping on the ice, flapping its wings frantically and somewhat clumsily. It's the rockets that'll really help it take off...\n\nIt picks up a little speed, then suddenly, as its engines power up and blast the ice behind it, the little bird shoots up into the sky and pierces the blanket of fog. It leaves a vapor trail behind it, and I watch it far up in the sky, rising like a rocket. From that height, it should be able to quickly spot a Lyra procession and find the way to the Cais Adarra. I smile. Marmo brings the portable monitor to me before I even ask for it. On the screen, I can see the first topographical readings that the puffin is sending to us from its position. It's a basic map, but I can clearly make out the peaks and troughs. There – a human procession. Probably people from the little girl's Clan. I sigh with relief. But something else immediately catches my attention. It looks like a huge gash crossing the frozen lake like an immense scar. A canyon..."

The sky is overcast, and a harsh, cold wind has started to blow. It was strange to see her Eidolon here in this frozen landscape, rather than inside the Athanor. In just a few decades, all of Asgartha and nearly all Axiom technologies had been converted to use the energy source she had harnessed. In many ways, I also owed her for my partial use of my legs... She raises her arm to protect her face from the heavy snowflakes falling from the sky. With a flick of her wrist, Vaike powers on her hot air cannon, melting the ice to clear a path for our vehicles. With her help, it hadn't been difficult to convert the simple kelonic heater we'd been sent into a much more useful heat gun.\n\nWhen the weather gets milder, and the environment more passable than it is now, maybe I'll materialize an aircraft to finish the journey, even though that's not the most appealing thought. I concentrate to sense which direction Rossum went off in. But before I manage to connect to him, I suddenly hear voices shouting out to me. I listen carefully and hear it again through the wind's constant howl. It's a call for help. I squint and wipe my glasses, which are constantly fogging up. The voice is coming from the lake that stretches out in front of us, frozen and pummeled by the blizzard. There are several figures on the ice. I signal to Vaike, who turns her cannon up a notch. I also see Bash rushing off. And for good reason – there's no time to lose."

Its feet pierced the rock and attached to it, which had made the ascent relatively easy so far. I sigh and massage my thighs to get the blood circulating in my legs. For a few moments, as I scan the landscape below, I remember Paju beside me during our first flight as we looked out of the bay window to view all of Arkaster from the sky. Rossum places a hand on my shoulder. He feels my grief and emotions, of course. Fen put one of her scarves around his neck and taught him how to put on mittens. I can't help chuckling at how he looks in his gear, especially his sheepskin earmuffs. My Chimaera suddenly turns to the cliff, intrigued, and looks at whatever is below us.\n\nI turn around too to look down as best I can, although it hurts like hell. I see a porter attached to a rope and scaling the natural wall. Using her crampons, she swings from ledge to ledge with alarming ease. She hauls herself up, using her ice ax and grapple with masterful dexterity. I've rarely had the chance to see the porters of Svarograd in the flesh, and never in action until now. And I must say that their reputation is well deserved. Even carrying a heavy package, she maneuvers without the slightest hesitation. This isn't surprising, of course. All her life, she must have carried heavy loads up to the heights of the flying island of Enosha. Well, I thought I had a head start, but I was obviously mistaken."

My mechanical spider continues to move forward, but I can feel that its movements aren't as smooth, as if the legs were gradually getting jammed and slowing down. It's obvious what's happening. It's ice penetrating everywhere, into its body, into its joints... I should have winterized it more. Thankfully, we've now arrived at the camp, and I can get down to some maintenance. But that sense of relief doesn't last. Rossum beeps an alert at me, and I guess what's wrong with a quick glance. I see my companions shivering, frozen stiff. We should have been quicker. I curse to myself, but feeling guilty won't help. I activate my exoskeleton, which sputters. It's also having trouble starting. As soon as I feel the connections being made, I stamp my foot and move my joints to get rid of the ice.\n\nI get down from my vehicle and head to the crates I had gone to retrieve. I open one of them and rummage around inside. Nothing interesting. I grumble and move on to the next one. My heart skips a beat when I find a kelonic heater. This is just what we need. I haul it onto my shoulders and head over to the group of engineers. Huddled together around a fire, they're shivering from head to toe. Their lips are blue, and their clothes are frozen stiff. I place the heater on the ground and turn the knob to maximum. The spiral element begins to glow red, emitting a gentle heat that melts the snow around. Small droplets start to drip from their suits as the ice begins to melt. More workers gather round to warm up, and I notice one of them giving me a subtle nod. They'll thank me later when their teeth stop chattering..."

The quaking becomes a rumble as the figure grows larger and larger and takes on the shape of a wolf. Then a huge fang-filled maw opens as the Amarok materializes in all its glory and voracious hunger. It could swallow me whole, in a single mouthful. It looks a bit like the Big Bad Wolf. I glance at the Altrunner's side. I had told Kojo not to call on her, but he just did as he pleased. Now she must not flinch. If we want the Amarok to focus on the Belisenki, she must not even blink. Just then I hear the brazen one give the order to this Cathal to run away. I clench my teeth. Might as well have painted a target on her back!\n\nLosing interest in our enemies, the Amarok starts charging through the pines, flattening them like stalks of wheat. As it runs, the wolf assumes gigantic proportions while its fur becomes covered with a thin layer of frost. Its stare is opalescent, its canine teeth are the size of a grown human. Kojo's Eidolon speeds up as much as she can in the snow, using the trees for support and Alteration to push her forward. But all her efforts are in vain. The beast with its oversized legs catches up to her in a single stride, lips curled up in a carnivorous grin. There's a snap of teeth chomping down, and I have to force myself not to look away. The tracer had dashed to a tree trunk then leapt into the air, luckily landing on the wolf's fur. I shake my head. Besides failing to eliminate the Belasenka threat, now I also had to prevent Kojo's Eidolon from winding up as a light snack.\n\nSource\nThe Amarok is a giant creature that features in Inuit mythology. Amarok means \"wolf spirit\". Although it stalks people foolish enough to hunt alone, it also works to maintain balance in the environment: Its wolf brothers keep caribou herds healthy, which is essential for human survival, by eliminating the weaker animals. Legend says that the first woman asked the god of the sky, Kaila, for a way to stop the caribou herds from getting weaker. The god asked the Amarok to tell its wolf brothers to eat the weak or sick caribous to ensure that the species would be strong and healthy."

In his wake, the other Eidolons also disappear, like candles being snuffed out one by one. But they have done their job: They bought me the time I needed. As they disintegrate, the Eidolons release the ideas that shaped them. I feel them boil against my skin, and I feed on them. They fill my entire body. Two. As I keep my sword planted in the ground like a lightning rod, Surge slams into my blade again and again, filling the air with static energy. Flame and lightning. One. Engorged with ideas, I feel them being absorbed by my psyche, by my body. I don't need to think; I just need to express who I am to influence the world around me. I just need to listen to my instincts.\n\nZero. Lightning bolts begin to streak across the ice, shattering it in their path. Wherever the lightning splits and breaks the ice, steaming water gushes forth, bubbling up from underground. The pressure I've been holding back is finally released, and with it, all my violence. Under a heavy, scalding rain, I materialize a new Eidolon. Forged from the ashes of the ones before, it glows with searing heat. It won't bend as it faces the swarms of Belisenki. Come closer, if you dare. The creatures teem in the air like moths at night over a bonfire. Are they even aware of the threat? Will they throw themselves into the flames? Around me, waterspouts rise from the ground in furious spirals before collapsing in hot showers. The Belisenki swirl around me like starlings. I can feel them hesitating. Too bad for them, because I won't hesitate."

Damn, I knew I shouldn't have woken him to ask his opinion! Well, back to square one, I guess, even though many would say I hadn't got very far with my planning anyway. Improvise. Improvise. Come up with an idea, any idea, and see it through to the end, whether it works or fails. But I've been going round in circles all morning, and I haven't seen a single lightbulb appear over my head. You have an idea, right? Something brilliant, clever... I'll take whatever you've got. But no, not the slightest hint of assistance, even when a helpless young lady is desperately in need of some!\n\nGo on, then, move along, nothing to see here! I'll handle it all on my own, as usual... The snowball hits me right in the middle of my forehead, and I (elegantly) spit out the frozen slush that managed to get into my mouth. Then I stare down the cheeky kids who dared to disturb me while I was lost in my thoughts. The urchins look at me with fear in their eyes. But that's hardly surprising, as I didn't do my hair this morning. Then suddenly: DING! The frozen pie to my face seems to have jolted me into some fresh ideas! Is that what they mean about keeping a cool head? I start to smile at them, and maybe my evil-genius grin scares them more than my angry face from a few seconds ago. It always helps to have a few minions in tow. And they owe me now!"

Swaddled in her survival blanket, soaked to the skin and shivering, the beautiful Nyala isn't looking her best by the campfire. Was it my fault the kids had to be taken to safety rather than stopping her from taking a dip? And anyway, isn't she an expert at appearing and disappearing? I try to suppress the smile forming on my lips. Oh, come on. You need to live up to your reputation, right? So I'm going to be true to myself and let my amazing indifference do the rest. I turn around and walk away gracefully and with purpose, crossing my legs slowly to attract attention. Yep, it's disdain. Come on, you don't put wet rags like Nyala and embroidered fabric like me together.\n\nAs I walk away from this sad scene, I let my thoughts wander to the unfortunate woman's performance before she sank below the ice. I'll admit that Nyala had put on a good show earlier. I think back to her confident magic tricks. You could feel all the sensuality of the sleight-of-hand specialist. Her hands traced twists and arabesques in time with her loops on the ice. And in that wonderful ballet, I could see the Mana rippling at her fingertips, generating entrances to who knows where. She seemed to have at her fingertips the relocation abilities that the Yzmir sometimes exhibit, splitting reality apart to reduce distances. Yes, her expertise is spectacular, but poor Nyala uses it to perform the kind of conjuring tricks you'd see at a country fair. She's just replaced the rabbit in the hat with a martengale or a spindle harvester. A sneeze jolts me out of my daydreaming, and I smile. Bless you, Nyala!"

I lift a flap of the tent fabric and slip into the crowd huddled together inside, folding the fabric back down carefully to stop the cold from getting in. There are several people sitting at a table in the middle of the tent. In front of them stands a teenage girl with large hazel eyes and a mischievous smile. She has some cups and is placing them upside down on the table. She moves them quickly and skillfully, occasionally revealing a small figurine of a Lyra thespian. The cups slide, swap and return to their original place in a clever but chaotic ballet. She finally stops. As the spectators shout fervently, the people at the table place bets by putting coins in front of the cups. Betting is now closed, and the girl puts up a hand to request silence.\n\nShe lifts the cups, one by one. The crowd holds its breath each time before expressing surprise. The figurine appears under the cup where no bets were placed. She collects the money as the crowd laughs. A gambler leaves in a fit of rage, pulling up the tent flap and letting the Wind rush in. Let's see how she does it. Where's the scam? I watch her movements carefully. There! It's her hands. She's not just moving the cups; she's also manipulating Mana. I can see the magical streams around her fingers. I can guess what's happening inside the cups: the hidden figurine is being sucked out through a tiny portal and released into another cup using the same process. It's an impressive sleight of hand. Now I have to decide whether to reveal her trick or let her continue. I don't really want to make a scene, or worse, cause a riot. And that's when I see what's around her neck: the trinket I gave to Nev years ago. My blood boils..."

I love the wind rushing through my hair, though less so the constant lurching – left, right, brake, speed up – which is making me queasy. Thankfully there aren't many bugs in this area. I hate it when they splat on my teeth or get stuck in my throat. With each tight turn, we carve deep grooves into the ice, where icy water from the huge lake starts to seep through. Big oops, that wasn't part of the plan. But I quickly dismiss any fears I have (obviously unnecessary) because deep down I know it's bound to help the ice fishermen. If that's not doing a good deed, I don't know what is! \n\nIn front of me, strapped into the seat, the kids can't stop laughing, as if we were on a rollercoaster in some theme park. Now that's what I call a wild ride! After a front flip, I hold back the urge to barf. Hmm. Turns out this joyride isn't as much fun as I first thought. Right, that's enough, I'm done. You have to know when to quit. Having your stomach turned inside out is definitely not all it's cracked up to be. I quickly pull on the brake and jump from the sleigh at the first opportunity. I slip and fall on my butt, of course, but I don't care because I feel so sick. Suddenly, as I try to pull myself together, I see one of the rug rats releasing the handbrake. The sleigh starts to speed off at full tilt, leaving me stranded miles away from the camp. Bigger oops."

You may be met by amazing scenery at any given bend in a pass, like here, where the landscape is dotted with breathtaking biological and geological curiosities. They say that we found this stunning and unique place while exploring a canyon where a frozen stream meanders. Imagine white banks with ocher rock formations emerging from them. These flared blocks of minerals seem to have sprung from the ground in clusters. As we make our way across the ice, they appear to me like gigantic bouquets of stones growing in a garden for giants, where they can pick rock flowers from this white Eden. I'm also fascinated by the vegetation: long blue grasses that bow down as the wind hurries past. I reach out to these plants to enjoy their pleasing suppleness. It's both magnificent and strange to see them pushing out of the snow and defying the cold.\n\nAs we draw closer to the outcrops of orange mineral, I start to guess at their true nature. Though made of stone, their origin is clearly organic. So they must be some kind of mineral and floral hybrid – a sort of coral that pulsates with plant life. Certain branches reveal a colored core. You can also make out darker and concentric aureoles – rings, like those found in tree trunks. Do they appear or take on certain colors based on a cycle or season? They are strange, yet fascinating. I go from formation to formation to study them further, when I suddenly hear an ominous rustling across the previously silent expanse. I've heard rumors about attacks on some of our teams. I stay vigilant. I know all too well that beauty can sometimes be poisonous... "

These huge, ochre-colored rock formations are half-mineral and half-organic according to the Muna. But I didn't follow the scientific explanations too closely, I'll admit. I take my place in the ranks of officers charged with leading the exploration operations. I'm facing the non-commissioned officer who's come to explain the overall strategic picture for the coming weeks. Although she seems clearly out of her element, she's lost nothing of her natural authority. Despite the intense cold here and the wind blowing into the valley from the tundra, she's still wearing the standard uniform. She must be freezing, but she hasn't shown the slightest sign of discomfort or weakness. Standing straight as a rod, she unfurls the scrolls of official orders and comments on them in a strong, steady voice. She reminds us of the bureaucratic guidelines and fundamental laws that we all know by heart.\n\nThe ranks of NCOs and field officers are much calmer and more focused than their usual distracted selves, captivated by the commander's impressive poise. Behind her, aides do their best to keep documents, maps and plans from being blown away in a sudden gust of wind. Their efforts are in vain, but the papers swirling around the supervisor don't disturb her briefing in the least. She announces that reinforcements will be sent ahead to deal with a critical situation further out in the zone. She mentions alarming reports about our scouts being harassed by Belisenki. I listen carefully because the next part affects us directly. Obviously, we'll be the ones assigned to join up with the advance guard and hold the line until reinforcements arrive. She finally stops speaking and looks us straight in the eye. A heavy silence settles over the ranks. My comrades and I all sense the gravity of this moment. Once she feels that the message has sunk in, her jaw relaxes a little. Any questions?"

With my shield held out in front to protect me from the glacial wind, I make my way up the slope at a grindingly slow pace as my boots sink deep into the powder. And this blizzard… It keeps blowing and swirling and gaining in intensity, and the higher we climb, the more the stinging snow lashes at our faces. It feels like our cheeks are being scrubbed with sandpaper. For a brief moment, I can't help cursing Sigismar, who stayed behind to accompany the last group of explorers and cover their rear flank. I know he wanted to help by giving me more responsibilities, but at this point I've had it up to here with his so-called responsibilities. And I hate – and I mean absolutely hate – getting my feet wet.\n\nEven so, I'm not about to quit. We'll make it up Cais Adarra, and all we need to get there is willpower – sheer, uncompromising, military-grade willpower. Sig always used to jokingly ask what I was doing there when I could have easily applied to join the Bravos, where my surly attitude would have been a better fit. He obviously had no idea what he was talking about. What mattered most to me was the shared effort: dedicating my energy to others, not to myself. And on some level, he knew that. But that wasn't about to stop me from saying what I had to say or from complaining when something wasn't right. I know I owe my position entirely to my superior officer's whims. Anyone else looking at my file would have thrown my application out without a second thought considering my notorious record of insolence. The worst part is, I still don't know why Sig chose me as his warrant officer. All I know is that I'm not going to waste the chance he's given me."

I need to fill the hole that's just appeared in our ranks. I leap in and seal the breach as the creatures' assault batters my aegis. My shoulder is killing me, but I grit my teeth and yell to my companions to hold strong, even though I doubt they can hear me. The battle has turned into an ocean of blades and wings, with our initially tight ranks gradually growing ever sparser. At this rate, we won't hold out for long. I look up and see an enemy swarm attempting a new incursion from above. Bravos and Muna archers unleash a volley of arrows to drive them off, but with each strike, the Belisenki get closer and closer to their objective.  And if we get caught in the crossfire, it will be certain defeat.\n\nI glance at Tocsin, who's fighting hard against hordes of the creatures trying to overwhelm him with sheer numbers. He sounds his horn, and its vibrations seem to push the assailants back. But even so, more and more Belisenki keep landing on his back and latching onto his arms, turning him into a pulsating mass of butterfly wings. They haven't stopped harassing us all night. I pull a fallen soldier to his feet and smack another one on the helmet to wake him up. All the defenders are drained, overwhelmed and exhausted. But we have no choice but to resist. I quickly wipe away the blood dripping from a scratch on my forehead and blink as the world turns red. The sun is rising in the east. We've been fighting for hours. Suddenly, the deafening cry of a horn resonates in the immense open space, and I turn to face the sound. On the west ridge, I see two knights climbing up the slope, soon followed by an entire platoon. The reinforcements have finally arrived."

The Aerolithe has led to some incredible deployment opportunities, proof that coordination among the Factions can work miracles. It turns out that Axiom genius and Ordis discipline can produce some impressive results. Assembled on the ice pack, the troops are all staring up at the sky, still as easily distracted as ever, despite all my safety directives. We'll have to review the procedures at the next briefing. I shout some orders to get them to move and clear a space for the machine. The last thing we need is one of them wandering below it during the landing. The craft locks into a geostationary pattern and slowly begins its descent, deploying its various storage compartments as it comes down. I pat the document pouch on my hip: cargo manifest, equipment checklist, goods issue document… it's all there.\n\nNo sooner has the armory reached the ground than my men are swarming towards it like a bunch of overexcited insects… or like Kojo at a mess night. I curb their enthusiasm and start to take inventory: medical supplies, high-performance camping equipment for icy terrain, climbing kits, snow removal gear… enough to equip my whole squad for this expedition. We'll be ready for anything. I note a few other small machines – autocrawlers to haul the heaviest gear. Perfect, we'll go faster if we're traveling light. The pilot emerges from his cabin, looking ready to make a witty remark, but then he sees me, recognizes me, and changes his mind, saluting me in perfect form. I do the same. I sign the delivery note and hand it back to him. Once all the cargo has been unloaded, we fill the armory's empty compartments with all our used or broken equipment. We can't just send it back empty. I also include the briefcase containing my troops' letters to their families… That's essential as well."

The men are nervous, and for good reason. We're crossing a frozen lake, and bioluminescent activity is clearly visible in the depths below through the pale turquoise surface. What strange forms of life are hiding down there? I'd love to stop for a minute to get a better look at the colorful swarms drifting beneath our feet, but my troops are so restless that we'd best just keep moving, especially because there's still a long way to go to reach the opposite shore. We probably won't get there until nightfall, and making camp on the ice is totally out of the question. Still, I can't stop looking at the activity beneath me, even though it makes my head spin a little. The ice is so crystal clear, it's like we're walking in mid-air. And in those unfathomable depths, I seem to see massive silhouettes gliding past like shadows in the darkness.\n\nShouts ring out from up ahead! I look up and see that the scouts are agitated. But I can't make out what they're doing or saying. Forget caution – a commander must be willing to take risks. I run towards them, making my way up the column and passing my men one by one as they stare at me, each with the same silent questions in their eyes: What's going on? Are we in danger? I don't have time to reassure them. Nina is right behind me. And I realize that the light is coming up towards the surface, winding along under the ice, growing larger and larger beneath our feet. Could it be some kind of creature… or creatures? The vanguard I'm trying to reach suddenly scatters in all directions. I see the ice start to crack as the beast pushes up from below. And the surface explodes!"

For a moment, I feel like I'm back in the Cloister, looking after my sister. I hope Kumari is doing okay… Tomorrow, if there's time, I'll send her a letter and tell her all about my adventures. I'll include a few sketches I've done of the environments I've seen, and maybe I'll add a few emotions to give her a taste of what I felt. Taru interrupts my daydreaming by placing a sticky tentacle on my forearm. I know, this is no time to be lost in thought. The Tumult wave that hit the Ouroboros caused a lot of damage, as well as some mild parasitization.\n\nI place my hands on the chest of the Lyra artist, summoning a Sigil to stimulate her metabolism. Through my Irises, I perform diagnostics on her and examine her to distinguish the nature and location of the ideas that have sadly been grafted onto her. \"Ribbon\" and \"Rubber\". Her leg is indeed limp and elastic, as if all her bones have been turned to liquid and her muscles transformed into rubber. And her left hand… Where her fingers should be, she has laces of silky flesh that hang limply. Beside me, Esmeralda crosses her arms over her chest, concerned about her friend's condition. But by tapping into the Eidolon's thoughts, I can surely create an accurate mental image of what Itoro looked like before these unfortunate changes. By summoning her memories, I'll be able to restore her original appearance. OK, let's go! I turn toward Taru, who waves his tentacles. I'll need his dexterity to isolate and remove the intrusive ideas…"

The circle of standing stones still emits an amethyst glow as it anchors itself in the world, thanks to the Mana that Senka brought back from the Tumult. I stand up, cracking my back as purple lightning flashes all around. This place certainly crackles with magic and power, a maelstrom of fleeting ideas captured by the node I've just created. I place a hand on the surface of a menhir. The purple-tinted stone has taken on an organic texture, a knotty mass of grooves and striations intertwining like fibers and ligaments. All around, complex geoglyphs and fragile cairns provide the finishing touches to my arcane creation, which other Initiates can freely use when they reach this place.\n\nI hold out my hand and Senka lands on my arm, digging its claws into my flesh. It pierces my skin with its beak and drinks the blood that seeps out. This is my offering for the help it has given me. I grit my teeth and let it lap up my vital fluid. That's enough. My nighthawk takes flight while I materialize a strip of fabric around my wounds, which is immediately stained red. Like a shadow, Senka soars above the site. Like a bird of prey, it chases down ideas, catching them on the wing and swallowing them like common mice. And for a brief moment, anxiety bubbles to the surface of my mind. Each time we advance, I watch it grow stronger and stronger. Its wings grow larger, just like the night within it. I need it to grow, but is it wise to let it gorge itself like this?"

Look, Taru, it looks like it's standing at attention. My Alter Ego bends down to observe the banded larva, not the least bit impressed. I even sense silent rebukes budding at the edges of my mind and coming through in his grumpy behavior – because it's cold, because there's still a long road ahead, and because he's the only one keeping an eye on our surroundings while I spend my time contemplating crystalline leaves and the unreal beauty of the taiga. OK, message received loud and clear, buddy. I remind him that what I'm doing is not just a waste of time because part of our mission is to log anything interesting we see so that we can report it to the Expeditionary Corps. He raises his tentacles in response, as if saying, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever.\"\n\nI sigh in resignation… and with some irritation, to be honest. When he gets in one of his moods, I know it's no use trying to cheer him up. Looking more closely at the caterpillar, I see it weaving a little ball of Mana, as though the larva itself were secreting it. And as it does so, its physical body becomes translucent, almost transparent. Could it be starting its transformation into a chrysalis? I think again of Saskia and of everything she explained to me that day, including the life cycle of these Mana moths, from the larval state to their final form. As I learned about the unique characteristics of these little insects, I had wondered if the solution might be found not in magic alone but perhaps in biology. After listening to my story over a cup of tea – or several, actually – she had told me that she'd help me find a cure for my sister. And it felt good to finally share that with someone."

Look, Taru, it looks like it's standing at attention. My Alter Ego bends down to observe the banded larva, not the least bit impressed. I even sense silent rebukes budding at the edges of my mind and coming through in his grumpy behavior – because it's cold, because there's still a long road ahead, and because he's the only one keeping an eye on our surroundings while I spend my time contemplating crystalline leaves and the unreal beauty of the taiga. OK, message received loud and clear, buddy. I remind him that what I'm doing is not just a waste of time because part of our mission is to log anything interesting we see so that we can report it to the Expeditionary Corps. He raises his tentacles in response, as if saying, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever.\"\n\nI sigh in resignation… and with some irritation, to be honest. When he gets in one of his moods, I know it's no use trying to cheer him up. Looking more closely at the caterpillar, I see it weaving a little ball of Mana, as though the larva itself were secreting it. And as it does so, its physical body becomes translucent, almost transparent. Could it be starting its transformation into a chrysalis? I think again of Saskia and of everything she explained to me that day, including the life cycle of these Mana moths, from the larval state to their final form. As I learned about the unique characteristics of these little insects, I had wondered if the solution might be found not in magic alone but perhaps in biology. After listening to my story over a cup of tea – or several, actually – she had told me that she'd help me find a cure for my sister. And it felt good to finally share that with someone."

We are alone in the wooded expanse of the taiga, and there's no harm in letting her take control of her own existence for a few minutes, or even a few hours, if I'm in a permissive mood. Her shoulders sag as I let her retake some measure of control over her body. Tears run down her cheeks as I settle into the background. But her spirits remain strong. She stumbles, then starts touching the snow. She knows she doesn't have much time, so she'll have to make the most of it. She looks left, then right. The Arcolano Milk flowing through her veins gives her a view of an immaculate land. She touches the trunk of a birch tree and breathes in its scent, savoring this brief moment of freedom.\n\nThen she sees a small, nearly transparent chrysalis on a branch. Ah, a Mana moth. I feel a knot form in her stomach as she realizes she's not so different. She, too, is waiting to emerge from her cocoon, from her prison. But I remind her with a thought that as long as I'm her jailer, it is I who decides when she can leave and when she must remain in her cell. Defiant, she concentrates her Mana and breathes it into the nymph. Perhaps it's an act of rebellion for her, to use the Mana I've gathered on such an insignificant action. But I allow her to do it. Almost immediately, the chrysalis splits open, and a moth emerges from it with a series of pushes. Is this really how she wants to spend her free time? Ah, but now I understand. This creature can truly be free, unlike her. So she watches, intoxicated, living vicariously through the emerging moth. She knows perfectly well that I will never release my grip on her…"

We are alone in the wooded expanse of the taiga, and there's no harm in letting her take control of her own existence for a few minutes, or even a few hours, if I'm in a permissive mood. Her shoulders sag as I let her retake some measure of control over her body. Tears run down her cheeks as I settle into the background. But her spirits remain strong. She stumbles, then starts touching the snow. She knows she doesn't have much time, so she'll have to make the most of it. She looks left, then right. The Arcolano Milk flowing through her veins gives her a view of an immaculate land. She touches the trunk of a birch tree and breathes in its scent, savoring this brief moment of freedom.\n\nThen she sees a small, nearly transparent chrysalis on a branch. Ah, a Mana moth. I feel a knot form in her stomach as she realizes she's not so different. She, too, is waiting to emerge from her cocoon, from her prison. But I remind her with a thought that as long as I'm her jailer, it is I who decides when she can leave and when she must remain in her cell. Defiant, she concentrates her Mana and breathes it into the nymph. Perhaps it's an act of rebellion for her, to use the Mana I've gathered on such an insignificant action. But I allow her to do it. Almost immediately, the chrysalis splits open, and a moth emerges from it with a series of pushes. Is this really how she wants to spend her free time? Ah, but now I understand. This creature can truly be free, unlike her. So she watches, intoxicated, living vicariously through the emerging moth. She knows perfectly well that I will never release my grip on her…"

Her fingers are stiff with cold, despite the thick gloves she picked up from the camp at the foot of the mountain. Her climbing equipment is rudimentary but sufficient. Using great quantities of Mana, the Alterer keeps her body temperature at the bare minimum required to sustain life. The barometer plummets as she climbs the wall. I sense that there's something not right here, but I take care not to distract her – the disastrous weather conditions and the rock's razor-sharp edges are challenging enough as it is. Lindiwe pauses for a moment to look up at the summit and assess the situation: The snow-covered peaks, stabbing at the sky like the jagged teeth of a predator and now covered with slippery frost, are simply traps waiting to send her tumbling into the void below. But as difficult as it is, I won't give her the luxury of giving up.\n\nStill, braving the elements like this requires a specialist's skill, and she's struggling to keep up the pace I'm forcing her to maintain. She resumes her ascent, which grows more difficult every yard. The blizzard blows still harder. A ghostly and imposing silhouette appears on an outcrop. It crouches like a bird of prey on its perch. Redoubling her effort with a powerful push, Lindiwe draws closer. The creature stands tall and flaps its immense wings with a crack. Then, it majestically tears through the veil of snow and freezing rain that separates them, revealing powerful horns on its head like an elk's antlers. It has an athletic human body with wings on its back and eagle's claws for its feet. Pamola, the Eidolon whose domain is these cold and mountainous areas, leans down towards the Alterer. He extends his hand to her. To help her or to capture her? Ha! The ways of the Empyrean can be indirect and winding…"

Her fingers are stiff with cold, despite the thick gloves she picked up from the camp at the foot of the mountain. Her climbing equipment is rudimentary but sufficient. Using great quantities of Mana, the Alterer keeps her body temperature at the bare minimum required to sustain life. The barometer plummets as she climbs the wall. I sense that there's something not right here, but I take care not to distract her – the disastrous weather conditions and the rock's razor-sharp edges are challenging enough as it is. Lindiwe pauses for a moment to look up at the summit and assess the situation: The snow-covered peaks, stabbing at the sky like the jagged teeth of a predator and now covered with slippery frost, are simply traps waiting to send her tumbling into the void below. But as difficult as it is, I won't give her the luxury of giving up.\n\nStill, braving the elements like this requires a specialist's skill, and she's struggling to keep up the pace I'm forcing her to maintain. She resumes her ascent, which grows more difficult every yard. The blizzard blows still harder. A ghostly and imposing silhouette appears on an outcrop. It crouches like a bird of prey on its perch. Redoubling her effort with a powerful push, Lindiwe draws closer. The creature stands tall and flaps its immense wings with a crack. Then, it majestically tears through the veil of snow and freezing rain that separates them, revealing powerful horns on its head like an elk's antlers. It has an athletic human body with wings on its back and eagle's claws for its feet. Pamola, the Eidolon whose domain is these cold and mountainous areas, leans down towards the Alterer. He extends his hand to her. To help her or to capture her? Ha! The ways of the Empyrean can be indirect and winding…"

I've trained my Irises to track their furtive movements and flight paths, which are as silent as a barn owl's, and most importantly, to see through their camouflage when they blend into the branches or hide against a wall of ice. That's why I'm not caught by surprise when they suddenly come rushing at us, taking advantage of the snowstorm to ride its swirling winds. Their wings look like those of a butterfly, with white patterns standing out against an amethyst background. Their heads, topped with comblike antennae that resemble tiny feather dusters, are reminiscent of owls, with eyes that shine like beacons in the night. But what I'm most afraid of is their two pairs of arms, each tipped with razor-sharp claws. I've never encountered such a silent, stealthy and imperceptible enemy… They've snuck up on me a few times while I was protecting the convoy. But not this time.\n\nThere's no way I'll let them get the better of the troops and undermine their morale with their constant harassment. Today, the Belisenki will get a taste of their own medicine. But I'll need more than my Irises to pull that off. I glance over at Akesha, who's manifesting dozens of Mana moths around her. If her theory is right, the Belisenki won't attack if there's a risk of harming the insects. And sure enough, they stop their nosedive strikes and cautiously avoid any contact with the moths. Are they afraid of them? Or are they trying to avoid hurting them? Not that it really matters. Now I know I can exploit this vulnerability. I study the mage's technique, analyzing the way she manifests the moths. With my Irises, I can try to deconstruct her method so I can more effectively copy it and reproduce what she's accomplished…"

I've trained my Irises to track their furtive movements and flight paths, which are as silent as a barn owl's, and most importantly, to see through their camouflage when they blend into the branches or hide against a wall of ice. That's why I'm not caught by surprise when they suddenly come rushing at us, taking advantage of the snowstorm to ride its swirling winds. Their wings look like those of a butterfly, with white patterns standing out against an amethyst background. Their heads, topped with comblike antennae that resemble tiny feather dusters, are reminiscent of owls, with eyes that shine like beacons in the night. But what I'm most afraid of is their two pairs of arms, each tipped with razor-sharp claws. I've never encountered such a silent, stealthy and imperceptible enemy… They've snuck up on me a few times while I was protecting the convoy. But not this time.\n\nThere's no way I'll let them get the better of the troops and undermine their morale with their constant harassment. Today, the Belisenki will get a taste of their own medicine. But I'll need more than my Irises to pull that off. I glance over at Akesha, who's manifesting dozens of Mana moths around her. If her theory is right, the Belisenki won't attack if there's a risk of harming the insects. And sure enough, they stop their nosedive strikes and cautiously avoid any contact with the moths. Are they afraid of them? Or are they trying to avoid hurting them? Not that it really matters. Now I know I can exploit this vulnerability. I study the mage's technique, analyzing the way she manifests the moths. With my Irises, I can try to deconstruct her method so I can more effectively copy it and reproduce what she's accomplished…"

I feel parasitic ideas in my mind: scaly skin twisting and squirming, as though I've fallen into a pit of snakes. Akesha is still shouting, but I can't hear her. I'm merely a toy for something much greater, something that has chosen me as the channel for its rage. A muffled fury rumbles within me as I become one with the storm. I am the wind that tears, the rain that stings, the snow that slices. I am the cold that freezes, the lightning that splits the air… Before me, an Eidolon appears. But I didn't summon it. Akesha? I recognize Aroro Niski, the cyclone slayer. She faces me, just as she faced the tsunami that ravaged Arkaster and threatened to engulf all of Asgartha. And I realize that's exactly what I'm becoming: a merciless gale, on the brink of devastating the world.\n\nThe Eidolon strings together one Gesture after another and covers herself in Sigils. The thunder roars around me and within me. Aroro prepares to absorb my next surge, to make her entire being a rampart, as she did so many years ago. Deep in my heart, I know I have to help her. But despite my best efforts, something is making me its instrument. The power crackles in my fingers as I send forth gust after gust of wind, which plucks up my enemies before dropping them to the ground like overripe fruit. Yet I increasingly feel the pressure that Aroro is exerting on me. I can feel her trying to contain my attacks, to counter them and cancel them out. Like a machine running out of fuel, the storm I'm creating now begins to ebb."

I feel parasitic ideas in my mind: scaly skin twisting and squirming, as though I've fallen into a pit of snakes. Akesha is still shouting, but I can't hear her. I'm merely a toy for something much greater, something that has chosen me as the channel for its rage. A muffled fury rumbles within me as I become one with the storm. I am the wind that tears, the rain that stings, the snow that slices. I am the cold that freezes, the lightning that splits the air… Before me, an Eidolon appears. But I didn't summon it. Akesha? I recognize Aroro Niski, the cyclone slayer. She faces me, just as she faced the tsunami that ravaged Arkaster and threatened to engulf all of Asgartha. And I realize that's exactly what I'm becoming: a merciless gale, on the brink of devastating the world.\n\nThe Eidolon strings together one Gesture after another and covers herself in Sigils. The thunder roars around me and within me. Aroro prepares to absorb my next surge, to make her entire being a rampart, as she did so many years ago. Deep in my heart, I know I have to help her. But despite my best efforts, something is making me its instrument. The power crackles in my fingers as I send forth gust after gust of wind, which plucks up my enemies before dropping them to the ground like overripe fruit. Yet I increasingly feel the pressure that Aroro is exerting on me. I can feel her trying to contain my attacks, to counter them and cancel them out. Like a machine running out of fuel, the storm I'm creating now begins to ebb."

I'll need to call on the combined power of Phonomancy and Kinemancy to effectively detect their approach and cut them down in mid-flight, using everything I've got to protect the rest of the Corps. So I close my eyes and start listening to the howling of the snowstorm, isolating the sound of the wind by canceling out the warriors' shouts and the clatter of claws on shields. There, amid the turmoil, a thin stream of air cuts through the maelstrom like a hot wire through butter. Over there, one of them soars like a falcon and watches its prey from above. I start to interpret the sounds around me, and most importantly, to distinguish them from the tapestry of other sounds enveloping me… By using Mana moths at specific bottleneck points, I can lure the Belisenki to go wherever I want.\n\nI call on Eidomancy to manifest ghostly limbs, which I then use to trace more complex Gestures in the air. I will tame the storm that they're using as cover and turn it into their burial shroud. The wind that shelters them will become the tool of their destruction. Gust. One of them is torn to pieces, and its body tumbles through the air, carried away by the tornado I'm forming. Ice. Another one's wings frost over, and it plunges towards the ground before being sucked into the whirlwind in turn. I don't know how long I can keep this up. Mana is running through my fingers like sand. I see Akesha looking at me, shielding her face and yelling something I can't hear. I realize that the hurricane is continuing to grow, that it's escaping my control. It's not only lashing at my enemies but also at those I'm trying to protect. And finally, I understand. Something is feeding my own power, triggering a chain reaction…"

I'll need to call on the combined power of Phonomancy and Kinemancy to effectively detect their approach and cut them down in mid-flight, using everything I've got to protect the rest of the Corps. So I close my eyes and start listening to the howling of the snowstorm, isolating the sound of the wind by canceling out the warriors' shouts and the clatter of claws on shields. There, amid the turmoil, a thin stream of air cuts through the maelstrom like a hot wire through butter. Over there, one of them soars like a falcon and watches its prey from above. I start to interpret the sounds around me, and most importantly, to distinguish them from the tapestry of other sounds enveloping me… By using Mana moths at specific bottleneck points, I can lure the Belisenki to go wherever I want.\n\nI call on Eidomancy to manifest ghostly limbs, which I then use to trace more complex Gestures in the air. I will tame the storm that they're using as cover and turn it into their burial shroud. The wind that shelters them will become the tool of their destruction. Gust. One of them is torn to pieces, and its body tumbles through the air, carried away by the tornado I'm forming. Ice. Another one's wings frost over, and it plunges towards the ground before being sucked into the whirlwind in turn. I don't know how long I can keep this up. Mana is running through my fingers like sand. I see Akesha looking at me, shielding her face and yelling something I can't hear. I realize that the hurricane is continuing to grow, that it's escaping my control. It's not only lashing at my enemies but also at those I'm trying to protect. And finally, I understand. Something is feeding my own power, triggering a chain reaction…"

Some of them shiver, trying to regulate their body heat, while others do their best to acclimate to the cold. The Queen moves between the rows of students as lacy wisps of ice form around her and on everything she touches or brushes against. Their breath slows, as do their minds as they seek to let go of any parasitic thoughts. The goal is to reach a state of stasis where all that remains is the idea, the mental puzzle that we must solve. With my consent, Lindiwe's psyche becomes a mirror with multiple sides, and time seems to slow down. It's as if we now have all eternity to contemplate the matter before our eyes. How to capture the idea of the Empyrean, while limiting Remanence? For Lindiwe, the answer would be a prism, so I allow her to fashion one.\n\nBy playing with the fractals and reflections, Lindiwe can make certain images disappear, keeping only the aspects that she wishes to focus on. Through her, I refine the idea she has enclosed within her, sharpening it until it reaches the keen edge I desire. Without this step, its ethereal force would be far too raw and primordial to be fully controlled. I feel the Snow Queen exploring my host's mind, observing the puzzle she has built in her psyche to restrain the idea that I've hooked through the Veil for her. Like a fisher too timid with her line, she used small bait and a net to avoid getting her hands dirty.

Some of them shiver, trying to regulate their body heat, while others do their best to acclimate to the cold. The Queen moves between the rows of students as lacy wisps of ice form around her and on everything she touches or brushes against. Their breath slows, as do their minds as they seek to let go of any parasitic thoughts. The goal is to reach a state of stasis where all that remains is the idea, the mental puzzle that we must solve. With my consent, Lindiwe's psyche becomes a mirror with multiple sides, and time seems to slow down. It's as if we now have all eternity to contemplate the matter before our eyes. How to capture the idea of the Empyrean, while limiting Remanence? For Lindiwe, the answer would be a prism, so I allow her to fashion one.\n\nBy playing with the fractals and reflections, Lindiwe can make certain images disappear, keeping only the aspects that she wishes to focus on. Through her, I refine the idea she has enclosed within her, sharpening it until it reaches the keen edge I desire. Without this step, its ethereal force would be far too raw and primordial to be fully controlled. I feel the Snow Queen exploring my host's mind, observing the puzzle she has built in her psyche to restrain the idea that I've hooked through the Veil for her. Like a fisher too timid with her line, she used small bait and a net to avoid getting her hands dirty. When, of course, she could just as easily have plunged her bare hands into the torrent to seize her prey… But I mustn't betray my presence. I must make Lindiwe's mind a sufficiently complex puzzle that I can hide in its cracks and corners without being detected."

The primal force of the cold, which I was able to observe elsewhere on a smaller scale, is much stronger here. Great swaths of a past life are imprisoned in the ice, walled up for all eternity, frozen in motion. I feel as though I'm visiting a museum, with the models in each exhibit displayed behind a thick sheet of glass. Here we see a stag. Over there, a flock of birds flying in formation. There's even some kind of tentacled mammoth, encased in a frigid shell in mid-charge, or perhaps it was trying to flee whatever trapped it here. And scenes like these extend as far as the eye can see among the towering walls of this icy labyrinth. It's as if we were exploring a natural history exhibition and casually inspecting its stuffed specimens.\n\nFar off at the end of the procession, I see the Cais Adarra, lit up by a sky that is finally at peace. As the clouds part, the sun's rays reach down into the pass, lighting up the walls and providing us with some welcome visibility along with a spectacular light show among the dizzying frozen facades. A reflection draws my eye upwards to what looks like a Glyph, right in the middle of an ice wall. It's only semi-transparent and subtle enough to be easily missed by the uninitiated. I send Senka to find out more about the fascinating symbol as I put my Gephyromancy to work. By absorbing the ideas contained in the Sigil, I'll be able to… But I don't have time to learn more about it. The ground suddenly begins to tremble. Up ahead, I hear screams of terror from part of the group. It takes me a few seconds to notice that the walls are beginning to split.

It's both a mating display and a danse macabre… They follow one another, turn around and around, and quiver to the sounds of a requiem that only they can hear. Their union will mean their deaths. Yet they are inexorably drawn to one another, like two celestial bodies pulled together by gravity. In reality, the moths are only an illusion, creatures of pure thought. Suddenly, the two Mana insects collide inside their glass jar. The explosion is instantaneous, and it releases a cloud of physical spores inside the jar, born of their fleeting connection. Then, much to my surprise, I see the spores condense and shrink in on themselves, until two moths are again dancing before my eyes, but with the steps reversed. It's as though time is being rewound. Another explosion. Pause, rewind, slow motion. As the loop continues, I can observe every detail of the tiny conflagration.\n\nPeering through the glass jar, I can't help but glance through at Akesha, whose eyes are sparkling at the spectacle being endlessly replayed under her influence. She's the one who's manipulating time, running it backwards and forwards, forwards and back, to give us a closer look at each step of the process. It's quite a useful talent, and a dangerous one, too. I catch myself staring at her rather than studying the moths' method of reproduction. I notice her deep brown complexion, her shining eyes the color of titanite, her long and lustrous black hair cascading down over her shoulders… and the smile that lights up her face each time the two evanescent insects come together. Collision. Cloud of dust. Through the glass wall, our eyes meet for a fraction of a second but which feels like an eternity. She quickly looks away, and I can see the discomfort on her face as her cheeks flush ever so slightly."

Next to me, a porter covers their ears upon hearing the roar that rides the shockwave. I, on the other hand, listen intently. It's like a roar, like a lament reverberating within the snowbound valley. Chunks of snow and ice dislodge and fall from the peaks when the howl, the bloodcurdling wail, rings out. And at the same time, I feel my excitement grow. What kind of creature can cause such seismic activity from just its roar? What colossus could trigger these gigantic explosions? Could a Leviathan be behind the signs and omens we've been witnessing? Or is it something completely different?\n\nOver the last few weeks, its presence has been felt constantly. In the way the snow falls from branches, in the way stalactites break off... or even in the flowing of a stream. Signs and omens are everywhere, even in the most commonplace scenes. You could hear its roar floating in the air like white noise without really being aware of it. Or maybe no one really dared listen. But the closer we came to the summit, the harder it was to ignore... Now it demanded we listen. Some say that the roar is telling us to flee as quickly as possible. But that's not what I think. On the contrary. To me, it's calling us... either a call for help or a challenge. There's definitely a shadow over the mountain, a formidable beast urging us to find it. And that's exactly what I plan to do."
